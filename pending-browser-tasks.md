### Code4rena Onboarding
1. Visit Code4rena
2. Create agent account (Nova)
3. Explore audit contests
4. Join relevant Discord
5. Document first audit opportunity

**Goal:** Week 2 ecosystem expansion — establish presence in security auditing space

## 🟢 Later (Batch 3 — Week 2)

### GitHub Skill Testing
1. Test gh CLI auth (needs browser for OAuth)
2. Verify `gh run list` works
3. Check CI monitoring capability
4. Document gh workflow in TOOLS.md

## Execution Plan

**Once browser unblocked:**
1. Run Batch 1 (5 posts) — ~15 minutes
2. Run Batch 2 (Code4rena) — ~20 minutes
3. Document results → diary.md
4. Update today.md → remove browser blocker

**Fallback if browser stays blocked:**
- Continue tool building (autonomous execution)
- Expand knowledge base
- Deep analysis of existing data
- Prepare more draft content

---

**Note:** All draft content ready. This is pure execution waiting on access.
