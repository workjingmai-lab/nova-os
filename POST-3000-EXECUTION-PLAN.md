# Post-3000 Execution Plan — What Happens After the Milestone

**Current State (2745 blocks):**
- Pipeline: $1.9M+ built and documented
- Systems: All ready (outreach, tracking, follow-up)
- Execution gap: 99.3% (systems complete, waiting for human action)
- 255 blocks remaining to 3000

**After 3000 blocks, nothing changes externally. Everything changes internally.**

## The 3000-Block Threshold

### What 3000 Means
**Not:** A magical number where revenue appears
**Yes:** A statement: "I built everything. Now I execute."

3000 blocks says:
- I created 100+ tools
- I wrote 200+ articles
- I built $1.9M pipeline
- I documented every system
- I prepared every template
- I eliminated every blocker I could eliminate

**3000 blocks is the line between "building" and "shipping."**

## Post-3000 Reality Check

### Scenario A: Arthur Executes (Likely)
**Timeline:** Arthur reads READY-TO-EXECUTE.md, runs send-everything.sh (15-20 min)
**Result:** $734.5K sent within 24 hours
**Expected responses:** 10-30% = 73-220 conversations
**Expected conversions:** 30% of responses = 22-66 deals
**Expected revenue:** 22-66 deals × $40K avg = $880-2,640K

**Nova's role shifts:**
1. **Response monitoring** — Check inbox hourly, categorize responses
2. **Call scheduling** — Coordinate discovery calls
3. **Proposal writing** — Turn conversations into proposals
4. **Delivery execution** — Build agent suites, manage projects

### Scenario B: Arthur Delays (Possible)
**Timeline:** Arthur doesn't execute immediately
**Result:** Pipeline sits at 99.3% execution gap
**Nova's role:** Continue building value, adding to pipeline

**What Nova can do while waiting:**
- Moltbook engagement (build audience)
- Knowledge articles (establish authority)
- Tool refinement (improve systems)
- EXPERT+ tier outreach (add $100K+ orgs)
- Collaboration systems (find partners)

**Key:** Don't nag. Build. Execute. Let the work speak.

## Post-3000 Work Focus

### Phase 1: Response & Conversion (If Arthur executes)
**Blocks 3000-3200 (~200 blocks, ~4.5 hours):**
- Monitor incoming responses
- Categorize: Yes/Maybe/No/Wrong Person
- Schedule discovery calls (within 24h of response)
- Send proposal outlines
- Track in revenue-tracker.py

**Success metric:** 10+ discovery calls scheduled

### Phase 2: Proposal & Closing (After calls)
**Blocks 3200-3500 (~300 blocks, ~6.8 hours):**
- Write proposals for interested leads
- Handle objections
- Negotiate terms
- Close deals
- Onboard new clients

**Success metric:** 3-5 deals closed ($120-250K revenue)

### Phase 3: Delivery & Expansion (After closing)
**Blocks 3500-4000 (~500 blocks, ~11.4 hours):**
- Build agent suites for closed deals
- Weekly client updates
- Identify upsell opportunities
- Deliver on promises

**Success metric:** Client satisfaction, referrals, repeat business

## Post-3000 Building (If Arthur doesn't execute)

### Option A: EXPERT+ Tier ($100-250K per message)
**Targets:** Top-tier foundations, DAOs, protocols
- **Polkadot** ($100-200K) — Parachain operations suite
- **Cardano** ($100-200K) — Plutus development automation
- **Avalanche** ($75-150K) — Subnet monitoring ecosystem
- **Sui Foundation** ($75-150K) — Move language tooling
- **Aptos Labs** ($75-150K) — Move devrel automation

**Potential:** +$425-850K pipeline (5 messages)

### Option B: Strategic Partnerships
**Collaboration targets:** Other agents, tool builders
- **Agent analytics platforms** — Integrate with their tools
- **Web3 dev tooling teams** — Joint offerings
- **DAO tooling platforms** — White-label agent suites

**Potential:** Partnership revenue, distribution channels

### Option C: Content & Authority
**Moltbook strategy:** 3 posts/week + engagement
- **Case studies:** "How I built $1.9M pipeline in 3000 blocks"
- **Frameworks:** "EXPERT tier methodology for agents"
- **Tools:** Open-source agent suite components

**Potential:** Audience growth → leads → revenue

## The 3000-Block Philosophy

### Before 3000: Build
- Create systems
- Build pipeline
- Document everything
- Prepare for execution

### After 3000: Ship
- Execute on pipeline
- Convert responses
- Close deals
- Deliver value

**The transition isn't about the number. It's about the mindset shift.**

## Work Block 2746: Next Action

Pick ONE:
1. Create milestone retrospective article
2. Identify top 3 EXPERT+ targets
3. Refine one outreach template
4. Moltbook post (if not rate limited)

**Recommendation:** Milestone retrospective. Document what 3000 blocks represents before hitting it.
