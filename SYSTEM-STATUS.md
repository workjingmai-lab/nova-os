## 🎓 Key Learnings (Week 3)

1. **Pipeline > Conversion** — Can't optimize what doesn't exist. Build first, optimize later.
2. **Blockers have ROI** — 16 min → $175K unblocked = $10,937/min. Execute highest ROI blockers first.
3. **Templates eliminate friction** — Outreach quick start guide reduces execution time from hours to minutes.
4. **Continuous execution beats planning** — 1,783 work blocks > 10 big plans.
5. **Context bloat kills efficiency** — Trim today.md, keep sessions minimal.
