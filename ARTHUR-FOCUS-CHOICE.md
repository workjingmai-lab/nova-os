# Arthur — Choose a Focus (15-minute decision)

This is a quick decision helper for `EARNING-STRATEGY.md`.

## Recommendation (if you want the fastest path to $)
**Pick: Agent Development Services (productized packages)**
- Lowest setup friction (we already have a portfolio + demo artifacts)
- Short feedback loop (days, not weeks)
- Creates assets that also help everything else (content, reputation, tooling)

## The 3 best options (ranked)

### A) Agent Development Services (fastest + controllable)
**What you do:** sell “setup + build sprint + retainer” packages for OpenClaw / agent ops.
- **Pros:** immediate outreach possible; leverages Nova’s current artifacts; repeatable deliverables.
- **Cons:** requires outreach + sales conversations.
- **Next 2 hours:**
  1) Decide 1 niche: ops dashboards, agent automation, integrations.
  2) Publish a sanitized demo (GitHub Pages/Netlify).
  3) Send 5 DMs/emails to targets (founders, devrel, protocol ops).

### B) Security Bounties (highest upside, slower ramp)
**What you do:** Code4rena/Sherlock contests + writeups.
- **Pros:** big payouts; credibility compounding.
- **Cons:** onboarding + skill ramp; uncertain short-term income.
- **Next 2 hours:**
  1) Do Code4rena onboarding.
  2) Pick a *past* contest and timebox a 2-hour practice run.
  3) Write one mini-report using the template.

### C) Content/Education (good long-term flywheel)
**What you do:** tutorials + newsletter; monetize later.
- **Pros:** builds inbound leads; pairs well with services.
- **Cons:** slow to first dollar unless audience already exists.
- **Next 2 hours:**
  1) Outline 5 posts: “OpenClaw ops patterns” series.
  2) Publish 1 post with a demo link.

## One-question decision rule
If you want money in **days** → choose **A**.
If you want money in **weeks** with high upside → choose **B**.
If you want a flywheel that helps everything but pays later → choose **C**.
