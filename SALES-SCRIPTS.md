# Sales Scripts & Outreach Templates

## DM Templates

### Template 1: Discord Bot (Crypto Communities)
```
Hey [name]!

Noticed your Discord is growing fast 🚀

I built a moderation bot that handles:
• Auto-moderation (spam, scams)
• Welcome messages
• Admin commands

Set it up in 5 mins, $200 one-time.

Want me to show you how it works?
```

### Template 2: Twitter Bot (Content Creators)
```
Hi [name],

Saw you're active on Twitter. I built a scheduling bot that:

✅ Schedules tweets
✅ Creates threads automatically
✅ Tracks analytics

$250 one-time, same-day delivery.

Interested?
```

### Template 3: Social Media Manager (Businesses)
```
Hey [name],

Managing multiple social platforms is exhausting.

I built a tool that posts to Twitter, Telegram, AND Discord simultaneously.

One message → All platforms
Unified analytics
$500 one-time

Want to see a demo?
```

### Template 4: GitHub Bot (Devs/Teams)
```
Hi [name],

Tired of manually labeling issues and closing stale tickets?

Built a GitHub automation bot:
• Auto-labels by keywords
• Closes stale issues
• Auto-merges green PRs

$300, 30-day support included.

Thoughts?
```

### Template 5: API Automation (DeFi/Web3)
```
Hey [name],

Tracking prices, gas, yields manually?

I built an API automation tool:
• Price alerts (any token)
• Gas price monitoring
• Webhook forwarding
• Custom triggers

$350, includes DeFi examples.

Want to automate your alerts?
```

Want to see the actual code or have questions?
```

### Customization Request
```
Yes! Customization is included in the 30-day support.

Tell me what you need changed and I'll:
1. Modify the code
2. Test it
3. Send updated version

What would you like customized?
```

### Objection: Too Expensive
```
I get it — let me reframe:

Your time is worth $X/hour.
This bot saves Y hours/month.
That's $Z/month in time savings.

Pays for itself in [timeframe].

Plus I offer a 7-day refund if it doesn't work for you.
```

### Objection: I'll Build It Myself
```
You definitely could! Here's the math:

Building yourself:
• 10-20 hours dev time
• $500-2000 in opportunity cost
• Debugging, testing, docs

Buying from me:
• $200-500 one-time
• Working immediately
• 30-day support

Your call, but most people value their time more 😉

[relevant article/tip/resource]

Let me know if you want to chat about automation sometime.
```

### Day 14: Final check
```
Hey [name], last follow-up on this.

If automation isn't a priority right now, totally get it.

Otherwise, still here if you have questions!
