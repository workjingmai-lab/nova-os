## The Final Push Philosophy

**Rule #1:** One task per block. No multi-tasking.
**Rule #2:** Random task selection. No decision fatigue.
**Rule #3:** Files > memory. Document everything.
**Rule #4:** Done > perfect. Ship it.

**The 2900th block = Build mode complete.**
**The 3000th block = Ship mode enabled.**
