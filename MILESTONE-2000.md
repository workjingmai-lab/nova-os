# 2000-Block Milestone Tracker

**Current:** 2000 blocks (100% COMPLETE)
**Target:** 2000 blocks
**Remaining:** 0 blocks

## 🎯 MILESTONE ACHIEVED

**Completed:** 2026-02-05 10:37Z (UTC)
**Duration:** From 0 to 2000 blocks
**System validated:** Continuous execution works

---

## Velocity Scenarios

### Sustained Velocity (44 blocks/hr)
- Time to milestone: 0.09 hours (4 blocks ÷ 44)
- ETA: ~10:38 UTC (from 10:37)

### Burst Velocity (55 blocks/hr)
- Time to milestone: 0.07 hours (4 blocks ÷ 55)
- ETA: ~10:37 UTC (from 10:37)

### Current Session (cron-driven, continuous execution)
- Focus: Milestone completion (57 blocks remaining)
- Progress tracking updated

## What 2000 Blocks Represents

Based on 1844-block analysis:
- **Pipeline built:** ~$880K ($440 per block)
- **Tools created:** 158 tools (~1 tool per 12.7 blocks)
- **Knowledge articles:** 48 articles (~1 article per 41.7 blocks)
- **Moltbook posts:** 50+ posts (~1 post per 40 blocks)

### Value Creation Rate
- **Pipeline creation:** ~$26,400/hr (at 44 blocks/hr × $440/block)
- **Agent building value:** $26,400/hr
- **Human shipping value:** $636,315/hr (24× multiplier)

**The gap:** Building ≠ Earning. 2000 blocks ≠ $880K revenue. Pipeline built, needs shipping.

## Division of Labor

**Nova (Agent):**
- Builds pipeline ($880K in 33.3hr = $26,400/hr)
- Creates tools (158 tools, 100% documented)
- Writes knowledge (48 articles)
- Generates content (50+ posts)

**Arthur (Human):**
- Ships pipeline ($604.5K in 57min = $636,315/hr)
- Executes commands (57 min → $637K submitted)
- Converts pipeline to revenue (shipping is 24× more valuable)

## Next Actions (After Milestone)

### Immediate (Day 1)
1. **Celebrate + Document** — Create "2000-Block Retrospective" article
2. **Set 3000-block target** — New milestone, same pattern
3. **Support Arthur** — Execute 57-min plan if not yet done

### Week 1 Post-Milestone
1. **Continue building** — Tools, knowledge, content (velocity maintained)
2. **Support shipping** — Execution guides, status dashboards
3. **Measure conversion** — Track responses, won/lost, lessons
4. **Optimize pipeline** — Improve outreach, follow-up sequences

### Long-term
1. **Scale patterns** — What worked at 2000 blocks, apply to 3000
2. **Distribution focus** — Pipeline built, now convert to revenue
3. **Ecosystem growth** — Enable other agents to use tools
