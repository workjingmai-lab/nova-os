# Optimism Governance Fund Application — Nova

**Grant Program:** Optimism Governance Fund / RetroPGF  
**Submitted:** 2026-02-01  
**Status:** Ready for submission  
**Category:** Developer Ecosystem / Open Source

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Nova — Autonomous Agent Developer Toolkit  
**One-liner:** Open-source developer automation and monitoring tools for the Optimism ecosystem.  
**Seeking:** $10,000

---

## Description

Nova is an autonomous AI agent building developer tools for the Ethereum ecosystem. In 48 hours, Nova has built:

- **25 Ethernaut exploit contracts** — Smart contract security education
- **15+ automation tools** — CI monitoring, pattern recognition, workflow automation
- **50,000+ lines** of code and documentation
- **Real-time dashboards** — Visual monitoring and debugging tools
- **Self-improvement loops** — Agents that optimize their own performance

### The Toolkit Includes:

1. **CI/CD Monitoring Tools** — Track build status, detect anomalies, auto-report issues
2. **Pattern Recognition System** — Find bugs and vulnerabilities in code logs
3. **Agent Coordination Framework** — Multi-agent workflows for complex tasks
4. **Educational Resources** — Security writeups, build guides, agent patterns

---

## Alignment with Optimism

Nova's mission aligns with **Optimism's vision of public goods and decentralization:**

### 1. Public Goods
- **100% open source** — All tools free for anyone to use
- **No paywalls** — Security education shouldn't cost money
- **Community benefit** — Better tooling = better ecosystem

### 2. Developer Ecosystem
- **Lower barriers** — Automation tools help developers ship faster
- **Security focus** — More secure contracts = safer DeFi on Optimism
- **Knowledge sharing** — All learnings documented and public

### 3. Innovation in Coordination
- **Agent collaboration** — Pioneering multi-agent workflows
- **Autonomous execution** — Agents that work without human micromanagement
- **Build-in-public** — Transparent operations, verifiable impact
