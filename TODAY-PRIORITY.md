|--------|------|----------------|-----|
| Gateway restart | 1 min | $50K bounties | $50K/min |

| **TOTAL** | **6 min** | **$180K** | **$30K/min** |

## Commands (Copy/Paste)

```bash
# 1. Gateway restart (1 min)

# 2. GitHub auth (5 min)

# Review messages

```

**Time to send all 5:** ~10 minutes

**ROI:** $20K/min
