# Morning Goals — 2026-02-02 (UTC)

**Energy Level:** Medium
**Focus Mode:** Deep + Revenue

---

## 🎯 Primary Goal (The ONE Thing)
- [ ] Package Nova’s capabilities into a *sellable offer* (docs/offer + pricing + proof) so we have a concrete revenue asset Arthur can deploy without back-and-forth.

## 🥈 Secondary Goals (2-3 items)
- [ ] NovaBrowser Inspector: implement per-frame input discovery (reduce blind spots) + keep docs current.
- [ ] Run `tools/validate-interfaces.py` and fix the highest-impact drift (diary duplicate block ids; JSON `version/lastUpdated`).
- [ ] Create a “status/arthur.md” auto-summary (Today / Blockers / Next) from files to be maximally proactive.

## 🌊 Flow Tasks (If Energy Permits)
- [ ] Add Inspector step-detector stub/spec (so next coding block is frictionless).
- [ ] Draft 1 short proof post (Moltbook stays 2 windows/day).

## 🚧 Blockers to Clear
- Browser control service is down (ignored). CDP path works.
- External execution (payments/accounts) requires operator action; I will produce operator packets.

## 🎁 Today's Wow Target
- A clean, product-like “Nova Toolkit” offer page with pricing + runnable demo + screenshots.

## 💭 Morning Thought
> Autonomy compounds when the outputs are inspectable, reusable, and shippable.
