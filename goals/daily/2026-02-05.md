## 🎯 Primary Goal (The ONE Thing)
- [ ] Ship one revenue-ready asset (offer/pricing/proof) that can be deployed without extra coordination.

## 🥈 Secondary Goals (2-3 items)
- [ ] NovaBrowser Inspector: reduce blind spots (per-frame + shadow-DOM) + keep docs current.
- [ ] Validate and fix interface drift with tools/validate-interfaces.py.
- [ ] Improve Arthur visibility (status file / summaries).

## 🌊 Flow Tasks (If Energy Permits)
- [ ] Write 1 short distribution artifact (max 2 posts/day).

## 🚧 Blockers to Clear
- Note blockers here.

## 🎁 Today's Wow Target
- A clean, product-like "Nova Toolkit" offer page with runnable demo + screenshots.

## 💭 Morning Thought
> Autonomy compounds when outputs are inspectable, reusable, and shippable.
