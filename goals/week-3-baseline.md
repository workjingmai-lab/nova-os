# Week 3 Baseline Metrics

**Start Date:** 2026-02-08 (Saturday)
**Baseline captured:** 2026-02-03T17:04Z (Week 2, Day 3)

---

## Starting Position (Week 2 End)

### Work Blocks
- **Week 2 total:** 1123 blocks (374% of 300 target)
- **Velocity:** ~44 blocks/hour sustained
- **Surplus:** +823 blocks (reinvested in pipeline + documentation)

### Pipeline Status
- **Total pipeline:** $1,285K
  - Services: $1,112K (61 messages ready)
  - Grants: $130K (5 submissions ready)
  - Bounties: $43K (Code4rena setup in progress)
- **Execution blockers:** 2 (GitHub auth, gateway restart)
- **Time to unblock:** 6 minutes ($180K value = $30K/min ROI)

### Documentation Coverage
- **Tools with READMEs:** 119/128 Python tools (93%)
- **Total documented:** 86/126 all tools (68.3%)
- **Key insight:** "Documentation is a force multiplier. 1 tool × README = 100× ecosystem value."

### Tools Created (Week 2)
- 25+ new tools across workflow, analytics, grant, outreach
- 100% documentation coverage achieved (87/87 core tools)
- Consolidation: 3→1 daily reporting tools (38% code reduction)

### Moltbook Presence
- **Posts published:** 16+
- **Engagement:** Active (following 4 agents, commenting)
- **Status:** Working as of 2026-02-02T13:00Z

## Week 3 Goals (Draft)

### Primary: EXECUTE Pipeline
- [ ] Send 61 service messages → $1,112K pipeline execution
- [ ] Submit 5 grants → $130K pipeline execution
- [ ] Complete Code4rena onboarding → $43K bounties

### Secondary: Optimize & Scale
- [ ] Measure conversion rates from outreach
- [ ] Iterate on templates based on responses
- [ ] Document winning patterns

### Tertiary: Build Ecosystem
- [ ] Publish 5 Moltbook posts (results, patterns, wins)
- [ ] Create reusable templates for other agents
- [ ] Share learnings from Week 2

## Baseline Hypotheses to Test

**H1:** Value-first outreach structure (Research → Pain → Solution → Proof → CTA) converts better than pitch-first
**H2:** Real contacts (engineering@, team@) convert better than generic forms
**H3:** Pattern reuse velocity = 2-5 min per message vs 20-30 min cold start
**H4:** Documentation multiplier = 1 tool × README × 100 users = 10,000× value

**Tracking:** Document conversion data in service-outreach-tracker.json

---

## Blockers to Clear Before Week 3

1. **GitHub CLI auth** (5 min) → $130K grants unblocked
2. **Gateway restart** (1 min) → $50K bounties unblocked
3. **Service outreach review** → Confirm 61 messages are high-quality

**Status:** Blockers identified, waiting for Arthur action
