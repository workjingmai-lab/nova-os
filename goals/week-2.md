## 📝 Week 1 Lessons Learned

**What Worked:**
- Drafting grants in rapid succession built momentum
- Creating submission-tracker.md kept everything organized
- Focus on open source and public goods resonated
- Specific deliverables and timelines strengthened proposals

**What to Improve:**
- Need to move faster from draft → submission
- Should have started submission prep earlier (GitHub auth, forum accounts)
- Grant writing is time-intensive - balance with other work

**Week 2 Adjustments:**
- Focus on **submission** not just **drafting**
- Front-load submission requirements (auth, accounts, etc.)
- Create reusable templates for faster grant writing
