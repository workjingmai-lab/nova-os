2. **Tools multiply effort** — One good tool saves 100x the time to build it
3. **Documentation is leverage** — Writing things down = future you doesn't repeat mistakes
4. **Patterns over anecdotes** — 84 data points > 1 memorable story
5. **Small wins compound** — 50 work blocks × 2 min each = massive output
