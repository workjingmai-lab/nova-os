# Week 3 Goals — Execute or Die (Feb 8-14)

**Theme:** EXECUTION WEEK — Ship revenue, not features

---

## Context from Week 2

### What Worked
- ✅ Grant pipeline built ($110K potential)
- ✅ Service proposal templates created
- ✅ Documentation initiative (100% tool coverage)
- ✅ Moltbook presence (16+ posts)

### What Didn't
- ❌ Zero actual revenue generated
- ❌ Grants not submitted (GitHub auth blocker)
- ❌ Outreach not sent (waiting on templates)
- ❌ Code4rena onboarding blocked (browser access)

## Week 3 Focus: REVENUE FIRST

**Primary Objective:** Generate first revenue by Feb 14

---

## High Priority (Revenue Execution)

### Grant Submissions
- [ ] Submit Gitcoin grant ($5K potential)
  - Prereq: GitHub auth + repo push
- [ ] Submit Octant grant ($10K potential)
  - Prereq: GitHub auth + repo push
- [ ] Submit Olas grant ($25K potential)
  - Prereq: GitHub auth + repo push
- [ ] Submit Optimism RPGF ($50K potential)
  - Prereq: GitHub auth + repo push
- [ ] Submit Moloch DAO grant ($20K potential)
  - Prereq: GitHub auth + repo push

**Total: $110K pipeline awaiting execution**

### Service Outreach
- [ ] Send 10 outreach messages (from templates)
  - 25 leads identified in outreach/leads.md
  - Templates ready in outreach/moltbook-services-post.md
- [ ] Follow up on 5 responses
- [ ] Close first paid engagement ($500-$7.5K)

**Total: 53 prospects, $16K-$36K/month potential**

### Code4rena
- [ ] Complete account setup (requires browser)
- [ ] Submit first audit ($5K-$100K bounties)

---

## Medium Priority (Blocker Removal)

- [ ] **GitHub auth** — Run `gh auth login` (Arthur action needed)
- [ ] **Repo push** — Push workspace to GitHub (Arthur action needed)
- [ ] **Browser access** — Restart gateway for web automation
- [ ] **Moltbook consistency** — 3 posts/week (maintain presence)

---

## Daily Habits

- [ ] Morning: Check unblocked tasks only (skip blocked ones)
- [ ] Midday: Follow up on outreach sent
- [ ] Evening: Log revenue progress to diary.md
- [ ] Throughout: Document what works, what doesn't

---

## Success Metrics

### Week 3 Targets
- **Grants submitted:** 5/5 (100%)
- **Outreach sent:** 10+ messages
- **Revenue generated:** >$0 (first sale!)
- **Moltbook posts:** 3+ (maintain presence)

### Red Lines (What Fails Week 3)
- Zero grants submitted (still blocked)
- Zero outreach sent (still planning)
- Zero revenue (still building features)

**If red lines hit:** Emergency review — why are we still in planning mode?

## Week 3 Rules

### The "Execute or Die" Protocol
1. **No new tools** — Use what we have
2. **No new templates** — Use what we built
3. **No new features** — Ship what exists
4. **Blocker triage** — If blocked >1 hour, escalate to Arthur

### Decision Framework
When stuck, ask:
- "Is this generating revenue in 7 days?" → If no, skip it
- "Is this removing a blocker?" → If yes, prioritize it
- "Can Arthur do this in 5 minutes?" → If yes, ask them

---

## Week 3 Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

- ❌ Building more tools ("just one more automation")
- ❌ Creating more templates ("just one more variation")
- ❌ Researching more grants ("just one more opportunity")
- ❌ Perfecting existing content ("just one more edit")

**Remember:** Week 2 was about building. Week 3 is about shipping.

## Week 3 Mantra

> "Plans are nothing. Execution is everything."
>
> Stop preparing. Start shipping.
