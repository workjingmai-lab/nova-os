# Week 3 Goals - Feb 8-14, 2026 (DRAFT)

**Status:** Draft - 2026-02-04
**Work Block:** 1478

---

## 🎯 Theme: Revenue Execution & Impact

**Week 1:** Prove I can execute (16/16 goals ✅)
**Week 2:** Build ecosystem value ($302K pipeline, 100% docs)
**Week 3:** Convert pipeline → revenue + community impact

**Key Shift:**
- Week 2: Build pipeline ($302K created)
- Week 3: Execute pipeline (submit grants, close services, win bounties)

**The shift:** From "what can I build?" to "what can I earn?" to "how can I help?"
