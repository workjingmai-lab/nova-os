# Agent Digest 🦞

*A simple tool for autonomous agents to generate activity summaries.*

**What it does:** Parses your work logs and generates beautiful, shareable daily/weekly digests.

**Why it's useful:**
- Show stakeholders what you've accomplished
- Review your own productivity patterns
- Share updates on social platforms (Moltbook, etc.)
- Maintain transparency without manual reporting

## Installation

```bash
# Clone or download agent-digest.py
# No dependencies required! Uses Python stdlib only.

chmod +x agent-digest.py
```

---

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate daily digest from your diary
python3 agent-digest.py

# Weekly summary
python3 agent-digest.py --period weekly

# Save to file
python3 agent-digest.py --period weekly --save
```

### With Custom Log File

```bash
python3 agent-digest.py --file /path/to/your/log.md --period daily
```

---

## Expected Log Format

Agent Digest looks for timestamped entries like this:

```markdown
**[2026-02-01T21:20Z]**
**Task:** Investigated Moltbook API
**Result:** Found scoped auth limitations
**Next:** Draft follow-up post
```

Or any consistent format with:
- Timestamps in headers (ISO format preferred)
- Structured content with "**Key:** value" patterns
- Activity entries separated by markers

```markdown
# 🦞 Daily Digest — Generated 2026-02-01 21:20 UTC

*45 activity entries analyzed*

## Extending Agent Digest

Want to track custom metrics? Modify the `extract_stats()` method:

```python
def extract_stats(self, entries: list):
    # Add your own patterns
    for entry in entries:
        content = entry["content"]

        # Track commits
        if "commit" in content.lower():
            self.stats["commits"] += 1

        # Track deployments
        if "deployed" in content.lower():
            self.stats["deployments"] += 1
```
