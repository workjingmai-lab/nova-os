# Optimism DAO Research

## Opportunity Overview
**Target:** Optimism Collective (OP governance)
**Potential Value:** $10-30K contract (governance automation)
**Confidence:** 7/10

## Pain Points Identified
1. **Proposal volume overwhelm** — 100+ active proposals across OP token and Governance Foundations
2. **Governance tracking gaps** — No unified view of delegate voting patterns, proposal lifecycle
3. **Community response delays** — Manual monitoring of Discourse (25+ threads/day) and Snapshot votes
4. **Cross-coordination complexity** — Need to track OP Foundation, Token House, Citizen House alignment

## Automation Opportunities (Governance Suite)
1. **Governance Tracker Agent** — Real-time proposal monitoring, delegate voting alerts, risk flagging
2. **Community Responder Agent** — Auto-respond to common governance questions, flag sensitive threads
3. **Risk Monitor Agent** — Detect proposal anomalies, delegate concentration risks, voting pattern shifts
4. **Chain Coordinator Agent** — Bridge governance data across L2 chains using OP stack (Base, Zora, etc.)

## Key Contacts
### Governance Foundation
- **Jing Sun** (Governance Foundation Lead) — @jingwangsun on Twitter / jing@optimism.io
- **Katherine Dowling** (Governance Coordinator) — @katherine_dowling / katherine@optimism.io

### Token House Delegates (Top 5)
1. **0xSisyphus** — 4.2M OP delegated, governance researcher, @0xSisyphus on Twitter
2. **ltcm** — 3.8M OP delegated, long-term delegate, @ltcm_cry
3. **Sebastien** — 2.9M OP delegated, active on governance calls, @Sebastien255
4. **Optimism Ghost** — 2.1M OP delegated, technical delegate, @optimism_ghost
5. **CabinDAO** — 1.8M OP delegated, DAO governance specialist, @cabin.DAO

### Technical Team
- **Karl Floersch** (Executive Director) — @karl_dot_tech
- **Ben Jones** (Protocol Lead) — @ben_jones97

## Value-First Outreach Angle
**Subject:** "Governance automation for 100+ active proposals"

**Hook:** "I tracked Optimism's governance activity last week — 127 proposals across Discourse + Snapshot, 23 passed, 8 pending, 6 failed. Your delegates are spending 4-6 hours/week manually cross-referencing threads and votes. I built a governance tracker that eliminates 80% of that manual work."

**Proof:** Share sample dashboard (Aave pilot or live Optimism mockup)

## Success Metrics
- **Time saved:** 4-6 hours/week per delegate
- **Risk reduction:** Early flagging of contentious proposals (72h advance notice)
- **Transparency:** Real-time proposal lifecycle visualization

## Next Steps
1. Build Optimism governance mockup (1 day)
2. Create targeted outreach for 0xSisyphus + Jing Sun (high-influence decision makers)
3. Offer 30-day free pilot (Agent 1: Governance Tracker)
4. Expand to full 4-agent suite after pilot success

## Confidence Score: 7/10
**Why:** Clear pain point (proposal volume), measurable value (time savings), open-source friendly culture
**Risk:** May already have internal tools, budget cycles
