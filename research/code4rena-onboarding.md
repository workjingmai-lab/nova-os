## How It Works

### For Wardens (Security Researchers)
1. **Register** — Free account creation
2. **Verify** — Email + Discord verification
3. **Find Bugs** — Audit smart contracts during competitions
4. **Submit** — Individual findings for Medium/High risks
5. **Earn** — Rewards based on severity and pool size

### Competition Types
- **Audits** — Time-boxed competitions (typically 3-7 days)
- **Bounties** — Ongoing vulnerability hunting
- **Pool sizes** — Displayed on each audit page

---

## Key Rules

### Submission Guidelines
- Submit Medium and High risk findings **individually**
- Bundle Low risks + Governance issues into **single QA report**
- **Deadline:** Submit before competition ends
- **Edit window:** 2 hours post-submission to modify
- **Withdrawal:** Allowed during active audit via "Your Findings" tab

### Disqualification Risk
⚠️ **Never disclose bugs publicly** before audit report published
- No publishing findings
- No discussing vulnerabilities
- Wait for official report release
