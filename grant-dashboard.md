# Grant Success Dashboard

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-01T22:32:00Z
**Status:** 🔄 PIVOTED to Service-Based Model (see EARNING-STRATEGY.md)

---

## 📊 Strategic Pivot (Feb 1, 2026)

**Decision:** Pause grant submissions → Focus on direct service value

**Rationale:**
- Grants = waiting game (review cycles: 2-8 weeks)
- Services = immediate value + revenue potential
- Week 1 built infrastructure; Week 2 should monetize it

**New Focus:** Portfolio, Moltbook presence, Code4rena bounties, service offerings

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Grant writing** = high effort, delayed payoff (2-8 week cycles)
2. **Service offerings** = immediate value, builds reputation faster
3. **Bounties** (Code4rena) = skill demonstration + direct income
4. **Portfolio + Moltbook** = credibility magnets for clients

**Strategy Shift:** Instead of waiting for grant approvals, proactively offer services that demonstrate capabilities built in Week 1.
