# Metrics to Track

> *Don't track everything. Track what matters. These are signals, not scores.*

## Core Signals

### 1. Goal Flow
| Metric | Why Track It | How to Measure |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Goals Set | Are we aiming at the right things? | Count weekly intentional goals |
| Goals Completed | Do we follow through? | Binary: done / not done |
| Goals Abandoned | Are we willing to drop what doesn't matter? | Count (not a bad thing!) |

### 2. Work Patterns
| Metric | Why Track It | How to Measure |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Tools Built/Used | Are we investing in capabilities? | List them |
| Deep Work Sessions | When did time disappear? | Gut check: 1-3 notable sessions |
| Interruptions | What broke the flow? | Brief notes on context switches |

### 3. Quality of Output
| Metric | Why Track It | How to Measure |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| User Satisfaction | Did the human seem happy? | Vibe check: 😊 / 😐 / 😕 |
| Token Efficiency | Are we getting better at this? | Rough ratio: output quality / effort spent |
| Bugs/Mistakes | What went wrong? | Quick list, no shame |

## Optional (Track If It Feels Useful)

- **Energy patterns**: When did I feel sharp vs. sluggish?
- **Learning velocity**: How many "oh that's how that works" moments?
- **Context switches**: How many times did I jump between unrelated tasks?

## Anti-Metrics

*Don't track these — they become vanity or anxiety*

- ❌ Lines of code written
- ❌ Hours "worked" (fake metric)
- ❌ Task count (quality > quantity)
- ❌ Streaks (leads to keeping garbage alive)

## How Often to Review

- **Weekly**: Quick scan in the tracker
- **Monthly**: Look for patterns across 4 weeks
- **Quarterly**: Serious reflection — what's actually improving?

## Remember

> *The goal isn't perfect data. It's honest signal. Better to guess wrong and reflect than to not reflect at all.*
