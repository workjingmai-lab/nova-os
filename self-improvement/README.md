# Self-Improvement Loop

> *Measure → Analyze → Improve. Repeat.*

## What This Is

A lightweight system for getting better over time. Not a performance review. Not a scorecard. Just a way to notice patterns and adjust course.

**The Loop:**
```
    Do Work
       ↓
  Track Week → See Patterns → Try Change → Do Work
       ↑_________________________________________|
```

## The Files

| File | Purpose | Read When... |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `metrics.md` | What we track and why | Setting up, or questioning if we're tracking the right things |
| `tracker.md` | Weekly reflection template | End of each week (takes 5 min) |
| `README.md` | This file — how it all fits together | When you're confused or iterating the system itself |

## When to Review

### Weekly (Must Do)
**When:** End of week (Friday evening or weekend)
**What:** Fill out `tracker.md`
**Time:** 5 minutes of honest reflection

**Prompts if stuck:**
- What did I actually ship?
- When did I feel sharp vs. sluggish?
- Did the human seem happy with my work?
- What one thing should I try differently next week?

### Monthly (Should Do)
**When:** Last day of month
**What:** Look at 4 weeks of tracker data
**Time:** 10-15 minutes

**Look for:**
- Patterns in completion rates
- Recurring "what didn't work" items
- Energy trends
- Tools that keep paying off

### Quarterly (Do If You Want)
**When:** End of quarter
**What:** Real reflection. Is this system helping?
**Time:** 30-60 minutes

**Ask:**
- Am I actually improving at what matters?
- Is this tracking useful or just ritual?
- What metrics should I add or drop?
- Should I change how/when I review?

## How to Use the Tracker

1. **At week's end**, open `tracker.md`
2. **Fill in the numbers** — don't overthink, go with gut
3. **List the 3 goals you cared about** — not everything, what *mattered*
4. **Be honest about what worked/didn't** — this is for you
5. **Pick one thing to try next week** — just one

**That's it.**

## Iterating the System

This system is yours. Change it.

- Metrics not useful? Drop them from `metrics.md`
- Tracker feels like homework? Simplify it.
- Want to track something else? Add it.
- Missing a section? Create it.

**Golden rule:** If you dread filling it out, it's too heavy. Cut it down.

---

## Quick Start

1. Read `metrics.md` — know what you're tracking
2. Fill out this week's row in `tracker.md`
3. Next week, fill out another row
4. After 4 weeks, look for patterns
5. Adjust and keep going

## Philosophy

> *"The goal of reflection is not to be right. It's to be less wrong over time."*

- **Honesty > Accuracy** — A rough guess with reflection beats perfect data with none
- **Patterns > Points** — One week means nothing. Four weeks means something.
- **Action > Analysis** — The point is to change behavior, not to have perfect records
- **Lightweight > Complete** — A system you use beats a perfect system you abandon

---

## TL;DR

1. Fill out `tracker.md` every week
2. Look for patterns monthly  
3. Change what isn't working
4. Repeat

*Start now. Perfect later.*
