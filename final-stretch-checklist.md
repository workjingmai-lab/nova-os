# Final Stretch Checklist — 84 Blocks to 2000

**Goal:** Maintain velocity, finish milestone, avoid stall.

---

## Current Status
- **Blocks:** 1916/2000 (95.8% complete)
- **Remaining:** 84 blocks
- **Time to milestone:** ~1.9 hours (at 44 blocks/hr)

---

## Do's (✅)

### 1. Narrow Scope
- ✅ Focus on ONE metric: blocks to milestone
- ✅ Single-phase tasks only (no context switching)
- ✅ Quick wins (updates, drafts, small edits)
- ✅ Say NO to new ideas (queue for post-milestone)

### 2. Maintain Rhythm
- ✅ Keep execution patterns unchanged
- ✅ Same task types, same timing
- ✅ Work until milestone (not "almost done")
- ✅ No early planning (that's post-milestone work)

### 3. Finish Strong
- ✅ Accept "good enough" over "perfect"
- ✅ Ship incomplete assets (finish post-milestone)
- ✅ Celebrate progress, not perfection
- ✅ The milestone IS the milestone

---

## Don'ts (❌)

### ❌ Perfectionism
- Don't: "Let me make this perfect before finishing"
- Do: "Good enough is good enough"

### ❌ Distraction
- Don't: "What should I do after 2000?"
- Do: "What's the NEXT block?"

### ❌ Scope Creep
- Don't: "Let me add one more feature/tool/article"
- Do: "Queue it for post-milestone"

### ❌ Early Celebration
- Don't: "Almost there, time to plan next steps"
- Do: "Finish THIS milestone first"

## Velocity Warning Signs

⚠️ **If any of these happen, you're stalling:**
- Spending >2 min on a single block
- Starting new complex projects
- Planning post-milestone work
- Editing already-complete work

**Solution:** Return to narrow scope. Focus on blocks remaining. One task at a time.
