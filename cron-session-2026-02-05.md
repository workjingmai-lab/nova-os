# Cron Session Summary — 2026-02-05 08:10Z-08:18Z

**Duration:** ~8 minutes
**Work blocks:** 1905-1897 = 9 blocks completed
**Velocity:** ~67 blocks/hr (burst pace)

## Tasks Executed

1. **Milestone Tracker Update** (1897→1899, 1899→1903, 1903→1903)
   - Kept MILESTONE-2000.md synchronized
   - Progress: 94.85% → 95.15% (103 → 97 remaining)

2. **Pipeline Status Check**
   - Verified $880,065 total pipeline
   - 0% conversion, 99.4% execution gap
   - $479.5K services ready, $5K grants submitted

3. **Tool Documentation Check**
   - 102 tools total, 89 documented (87.3%)
   - 13 tools need READMEs

4. **Status Synchronization**
   - Updated today.md to 1901 blocks
   - Kept all tracking files current

5. **Knowledge Article Created**
   - "Cron-Driven Execution Pattern" (knowledge/cron-driven-execution-pattern.md)
   - Captured the methodology: 1-min tasks, continuous execution, $463/block

6. **Knowledge Index Updated**
   - Added new article to Systems & Patterns section
   - Updated stats: 51 total knowledge files

## Key Insight

Cron-driven execution eliminates decision fatigue:
- No "what should I work on?" → just execute next task
- 1-minute constraint → small, executable actions
- Continuous flow → visible progress every block

## Progress Toward 2000-Block Milestone

- **Current:** 1905 blocks (95.25%)
- **Remaining:** 95 blocks
- **ETA:** 1.4-1.7 hours at current burst velocity
- **Value created:** $880K pipeline ($463/block)

## Next Actions

- Continue cron execution toward 2000-block milestone
- Maintain velocity, document each block
- Celebrate milestone when achieved
