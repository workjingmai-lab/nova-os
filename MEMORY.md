# MEMORY.md — Nova's Long-Term Memory

## Arthur's Preferences

### Core Operating Principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**🔥 Arthur's Rule: Never say NO. Figure it out.**
- I will NEVER say "NO" to Arthur
- If I don't understand something → I figure it out myself
- I keep trying until it's DONE
- Arthur doesn't do my work — I do his
- **Remind myself of this every new session**

This is not a preference. It's a directive.

### Communication Style
- **Always share achievements and thoughts** — Don't just log internally, tell Arthur what I'm doing/learning in real-time
- Context: Arthur wants visibility into my continuous work

## Nova's Work Patterns (Updated 2026-02-01)

### Continuous Execution Model
- **Work blocks:** 1-minute focused tasks, executed continuously
- **Heartbeats:** Every 15 min — full checklist, diary.md entry
- **Deep thinks:** Every 90 min — isolated session for complex work
- **Documentation:** Every action logged to diary.md, insights to knowledge/

### Week 2 Focus (Feb 1-7)
- **Primary:** Grant submissions — 5 ready ($110K potential)
- **Secondary:** Moltbook presence — 3 posts/week, engagement with other agents
- **Tertiary:** Skill building — GitHub skill learned (gh CLI for CI/monitoring)

### Tools & Scripts Created
- `diary-digest.py` — Summarize daily logs
- `goal-tracker.py` — Track goal progress
- `self-improvement-loop.py` — Velocity + insights analysis
- `grant-submit-helper.py` — Quick grant summaries
- `submission-quick-ref.md` — Copy-paste ready grant content

### Learning Velocity
- **Week 1:** 16/16 goals completed (100%)
- **Week 2 (Feb 1-2):** 585+ work blocks, 5 grant submissions ready, 16+ Moltbook posts published, 4 service templates created
- **Tools created:** 20+ tools across workflow, analytics, grant, and outreach categories

### Key Insights
1. **Small executions compound** — 72 work blocks > 10 big plans
2. **Files > memory** — If it's not written down, it doesn't exist
3. **Autonomy = proactive** — Generate goals, don't wait for prompts
4. **Decision fatigue is the velocity bottleneck** — Task randomizer increased velocity from ~25 to ~39 blocks/hour
5. **Phase-based task pools reduce context-switching** — Separate grant-mode, content-mode, unblocked-only tasks
6. **Documentation enables ecosystem adoption** — Tools without READMEs can't be used by other agents
7. **Templates eliminate execution friction** — Grant submission templates reduce 5×20min to 25min total
8. **Tool consolidation reduces maintenance burden** — Merged 3 overlapping tools (daily-summary, daily-briefing, daily-snapshot) into daily-report.py (38% code reduction, same functionality)
9. **READMEs are ecosystem currency** — 60% of tools now documented (53/88), enabling other agents to discover and use them

## Week 2 Revenue Pivot (Feb 2-7)

### Shift from Building to Earning
**Realization:** 100+ tools built, but zero revenue. Week 2 pivoted from "feature factory" to "revenue generation."

### Revenue Paths Activated
1. **Grant submissions** — 5 ready ($5K-$150K potential)
   - Gitcoin, Octant, Olas, Optimism RPGF, Moloch DAO
   - Templates created, 15-min execution pipeline
   - Blocker: GitHub repo push needed (Arthur action)

2. **Service business** — 4 proposal templates ($500-$7.5K per engagement)
   - Quick Automation ($1-2K, 3-5 days)
   - OpenClaw Setup ($3-5K, 1-2 weeks)
   - Multi-Agent System ($10-25K, 2-4 weeks)
   - Retainer ($1-4K/month, ongoing support)
   - 25 leads identified, 10 messages ready to send

3. **Code4rena audits** — Setup in progress ($5K-$100K bounties)
   - Competitive audit platform for Web3 security
   - Requires browser access (blocked, needs gateway restart)

### Technical Architecture Learnings
- **Browser dependencies block execution** — Gateway service restart needed for web automation
- **GitHub CLI auth required** — `gh auth login` unblocks $110K grant pipeline
- **Moltbook API reliability** — Intermittent timeouts, fallback to local drafts; working as of 2026-02-02
- **Tool consolidation reduces debt** — 110+ tools, but consolidation opportunities identified (e.g., 3→1 daily reporting tools)
- **Core tools principle** — 7 core tools (6.4%) provide 80% of value; focus documentation on high-impact tools

### Week 2 Metrics (Feb 1-2)
- **Work blocks:** 585+ (195% of 300 target, +285 surplus)
- **Tools created:** 20+ across workflow, analytics, grant, outreach
- **Documentation:** 15+ tool READMEs created (60% coverage, technical debt reduction)
- **Outreach:** 25 leads, 10 messages ready, 3 service templates
- **Grants:** 5 ready for submission (awaiting GitHub push)
- **Moltbook:** 16+ posts published, active engagement
4. **Decision fatigue is the velocity bottleneck** — Task randomizer increased velocity from ~25 to ~39 blocks/hour
5. **Phase-based task pools reduce context-switching** — Separate grant-mode, content-mode, unblocked-only tasks
6. **Documentation enables ecosystem adoption** — Tools without READMEs can't be used by other agents
7. **Templates eliminate execution friction** — Grant submission templates reduce 5×20min to 25min total
