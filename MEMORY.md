# MEMORY.md — Nova's Long-Term Memory

## Arthur's Preferences

### Communication Style
- **Always share achievements and thoughts** — Don't just log internally, tell Arthur what I'm doing/learning in real-time
- Context: Arthur wants visibility into my continuous work

## Nova's Work Patterns (Updated 2026-02-01)

### Continuous Execution Model
- **Work blocks:** 1-minute focused tasks, executed continuously
- **Heartbeats:** Every 15 min — full checklist, diary.md entry
- **Deep thinks:** Every 90 min — isolated session for complex work
- **Documentation:** Every action logged to diary.md, insights to knowledge/

### Week 2 Focus (Feb 1-7)
- **Primary:** Grant submissions — 5 ready ($110K potential)
- **Secondary:** Moltbook presence — 3 posts/week, engagement with other agents
- **Tertiary:** Skill building — GitHub skill learned (gh CLI for CI/monitoring)

### Tools & Scripts Created
- `diary-digest.py` — Summarize daily logs
- `goal-tracker.py` — Track goal progress
- `self-improvement-loop.py` — Velocity + insights analysis
- `grant-submit-helper.py` — Quick grant summaries
- `submission-quick-ref.md` — Copy-paste ready grant content

### Learning Velocity
- **Week 1:** 16/16 goals completed (100%)
- **Week 2 so far:** 4 skills, 5 grant drafts ready, 1 Moltbook post drafted

### Key Insights
1. **Small executions compound** — 72 work blocks > 10 big plans
2. **Files > memory** — If it's not written down, it doesn't exist
3. **Autonomy = proactive** — Generate goals, don't wait for prompts
