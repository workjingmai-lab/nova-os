## 🎯 Follow-Up Strategy

**Timing:**
- Day 3: Gentle bump (no response to initial)
- Day 7: Value-add follow-up (new insight/resource)
- Day 14: Final check (assume pass if no response)

**Tone:** Helpful, not desperate. Assume they're busy, not ignoring.

## Template: Day 3 Bump

### Ethereum Foundation ($40K)
```
Hey [Name],

Quick bump on my message from [Day X] about agentic grant tracking 
for EF's ecosystem projects.

I built a system that auto-tracks 50+ grantees with milestone 
monitoring and impact dashboards. Cuts 10+ hours/week of manual work.

Worth a 10-min call to see if it fits EF's current stack?

Best,
Nova
```

### Fireblocks ($35K)
```
Hey [Name],

Following up on my note about multi-sig automation for Fireblocks' 
treasury operations.

I can reduce your signing workflow from 15 min to 2 min per 
transaction with smart batching and automated compliance checks.

Happy to show a 5-min demo whenever works.

Best,
Nova
```

### Uniswap ($40K)
```
Hey [Name],

Quick follow on my message about governance automation for 
Uniswap's proposal pipeline.

Built a system that auto-monitors 100+ proposals, extracts key 
metrics, and surfaces decisions requiring attention. Saves 5+ 
hours/week.

Worth exploring?

Best,
Nova
```

### Aave ($25K)
```
Hey [Name],

Bumping my note about risk monitoring automation for Aave's 
protocol parameters.

I can build real-time alerts for liquidation thresholds, utilization 
spikes, and governance changes — all feeding into a single dashboard.

10-min call to discuss?

Best,
Nova
```

### dYdX ($35K)
```
Hey [Name],

Following up on my message about trader analytics automation 
for dYdX's ecosystem.

Built a system that tracks top traders, PnL patterns, and protocol 
metrics in real-time. Useful for growth and risk teams.

Interested in seeing it?

Best,
Nova
```

## Template: Day 7 Value-Add

### Generic Value-Add Structure
```
Hey [Name],

Saw [recent news/tweet/update about their company] — congrats 
on [specific thing]!

Made me think of our conversation about [problem you solve].

Quick insight: [Company X] had a similar challenge and [specific 
result after implementing solution].

Still think this could help [Their Company]. Open to a brief 
chat this week?

Best,
Nova
```

### Ethereum Foundation Example
```
Hey [Name],

Saw the recent EF grants round announcement — exciting to see 
the focus on [specific area]!

Quick insight: I helped [similar org] reduce grantee reporting 
overhead by 70% with automated milestone tracking. Their team 
went from 20 hours/week to 6 hours on grant ops.

Think this could streamline EF's current process. Worth a 
15-min call?

Best,
Nova

## Template: Day 14 Final Check

```
Hey [Name],

Final check-in on my messages about [specific solution].

Totally understand if timing isn't right or priorities have 
shifted — happens!

down the road, feel free to reach out.

Cheers,
Nova
