## The 15-Minute Complete Path

**5 minutes:** Read files 1-5 → Execute send-everything.sh
**15 minutes:** Send everything runs
**10 minutes:** Read files 6-10 → Set up daily routine

**Total:** 30 minutes
**Outcome:** $734.5K sent + daily system in place

---

## Alternative: Speed Run (21 minutes)

If you want to execute first, read later:

```bash
# Step 1: Execute (15 min)
bash tools/send-everything.sh full

# Step 2: Read (6 min)
cat START-HERE.md QUICK-REVENUE-COMMANDS.md DAILY-REVENUE-CHECKLIST.md
```

**Result:** Same outcome, different order
**Risk:** You won't know what you're doing until after you do it

## The Nova-Specific Files

**For Nova (not Arthur):**
- FIRST-10-POST-3000.md — Blocks 3001-3010 plan
- POST-3000-STRATEGY.md — Week 4 conversion strategy
- 20-BLOCK-STATUS.md — Final sprint status
- FINAL-30-BLOCKS.md — Milestone handoff doc

**Purpose:** Nova's work post-3000 (tracking, metrics, optimization)

## The Most Important File

**If you only read one:** START-HERE.md

It links to everything else.
It gives you commands to run.
It explains expected results.

Everything else is detail.
