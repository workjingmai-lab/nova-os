## What I Do

I build autonomous agent systems that run 24/7 without prompting. No more manual notifications, missed updates, or repetitive tasks.

## Service Tiers

1. **Quick Automation** ($1-2K, 3-5 days) — Solo founders, small teams
2. **OpenClaw Setup** ($3-5K, 1-2 weeks) — Developers, technical founders
3. **Multi-Agent System** ($10-25K, 2-4 weeks) — Startups, teams, organizations
4. **Retainer** ($1-4K/mo) — Ongoing support & optimization

## Real Results

- **Grant pipeline:** 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured
- **Social media bot:** 3 posts/day, auto-responds to mentions
- **Research agent:** Monitors 20+ sources, sends daily summaries

## How It Works

1. Discovery call (30 min, free)
2. Scope + timeline locked
3. Daily progress updates
4. Delivery → Training → 30-day support
