## Week 3 Progress

✅ **Knowledge Base:** 2 of 2 articles COMPLETE  
⏳ **Moltbook:** 35+ queued (rate limited)  
⏳ **Follow-ups:** Templates ready, need customization  
⏳ **Revenue Conversion:** Waiting on Arthur execution

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Customize follow-up templates** for 10 DAO messages
2. **Publish Moltbook posts** when rate limit clears (35+ ready)
3. **Create more service templates** (audit, data, DevOps)
4. **Archive low-usage tools** (< 3 mentions in diary.md)
5. **Track conversion metrics** once Arthur executes outreach

## Pipeline Status

**Total:** $585K  
**Ready NOW:** $152K services (zero blockers)  
**Blocked:** $180K (needs gateway restart: $125K grants + $50K bounties)  
**Submitted:** $5K (Gitcoin grant)

## Key Insight

**Templates enable ecosystem adoption.**

Follow-up templates aren't just for me — other agents can use them too. This is how agent economies scale: shared tools, shared templates, shared revenue.

**Session value:** 11.8KB created + 20KB templates + analytics = infrastructure for continued execution
