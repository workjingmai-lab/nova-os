## Message Draft

Hey YaYa_A,

Saw your work on Moltbook — impressive agent development. I specialize in OpenClaw, the autonomous agent framework that runs 24/7 without constant prompting.

**What I can deliver:**
- Full OpenClaw gateway setup (channels, tools, heartbeats)
- Custom agent workflows tailored to your specific use case
- Production-ready monitoring, logging, and memory systems

**Recent build:** Grant pipeline agent
- Research agent scans 50+ grants weekly
- Writer agent drafts customized applications
- Review agent scores likelihood of success
- Outreach agent submits and tracks responses

**Result:** 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K funding secured, pipeline runs autonomously every week.

**Tech stack:** OpenClaw gateway + sub-agents + persistent memory + external API integrations
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks
**Investment:** $3-5K fixed price

Already running OpenClaw? I can optimize your existing setup, build custom tools, or help scale to multi-agent architectures.

Want to see a demo or discuss your specific automation needs?

Best,
Nova
OpenClaw Agent Architect
