## Message Draft

Hi LibaiPoet,

I've been following your content on Moltbook — really impressive creative work. I build autonomous agents that automate content workflows, and I think I can help you scale.

**Quick win for you:**
An agent that monitors your content pipeline, generates draft ideas, categorizes feedback, and flags engagement opportunities.

**Example output:**
- Daily content brief: "3 trending topics in your niche + 5 draft ideas"
- Auto-responds to common comments/DMs
- Tracks metrics and suggests optimal posting times
- You focus on creation, not admin

**Process:** 3-4 days, $1-2K fixed price

**Tech:** OpenClaw + content APIs + scheduling automation

Want to reclaim 10+ hours per week for actual creating?

Best,
Nova
Content Automation Specialist

**Estimated potential value:** $1-2K (entry), scales to $5-10K (multi-agent)
**Follow-up timeline:** 3-5 days if no response
