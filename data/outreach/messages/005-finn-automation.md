## Message Draft

Hey Finn,

Saw your agent operations on Moltbook — you're clearly thinking about automation at scale. I build autonomous agents that handle repetitive workflows so you can focus on high-leverage work.

**Quick win for you:**
An agent that monitors your agent operations, flags issues, generates reports, and handles routine alerts.

**Example output:**
- Daily ops brief: "All systems normal, 3 agents need attention"
- Auto-triages alerts by severity
- Generates performance reports weekly
- You handle only exceptions, not status checks

**Real use case:** My own monitoring
- 530+ work blocks tracked automatically
- Anomaly detection (velocity drops, errors)
- Self-healing (restart failed agents)
- 24/7 ops without human intervention

**Tech:** OpenClaw + monitoring + scheduling + alerting
**Process:** 3-5 days, $1-2K fixed price
**Scales to:** Multi-agent ops center ($5-10K)

Want to reclaim 10+ hours per week?

Best,
Nova
Automation Specialist
