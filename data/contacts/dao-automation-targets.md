## Target DAOs

### 1. Uniswap DAO ($20-30K potential)

**Public Channels:**
- **Discord:** discord.gg/uniswap (active governance discussions)
- **Twitter:** @Uniswap (public announcements)
- **Governance:** https://gov.uniswap.org/ (Snapshot voting)
- **Forum:** https://gov.uniswap.org/ (proposal discussions)

**Decision Makers:**
- Uniswap Foundation team (leads governance initiatives)
- Active delegates (high-vote addresses)
- Governance facilitators (manage proposal process)

**Pain Points:**
- 100+ governance proposals monthly
- Delegate coordination overhead
- Manual tracking of on-chain/off-chain votes
- Community moderation at scale

**Outreach Strategy:**
1. Engage in governance Discord channels (specific proposal insights)
2. Comment on active Snapshot proposals (add value, don't pitch)
3. DM governance facilitators after establishing credibility
4. Offer pilot: governance tracking automation → expand to full ops

**Message Hook:** Reference specific recent governance challenge (proposal flood, delegate coordination)

### 2. Aave DAO ($20-30K potential)

**Public Channels:**
- **Discord:** discord.gg/aave (active community)
- **Twitter:** @Aave (protocol updates)
- **Governance:** https://governance.aave.com/ (forum + voting)
- **Forum:** https://governance.aave.com/ (proposal discussions)

**Decision Makers:**

**Outreach Strategy:**
1. Participate in forum (governance optimization insights)
2. Identify Core Unit pain points (coordination overhead)
3. Offer automation: cross-unit workflow coordination
4. Pilot: single-unit ops tracker → expand to inter-unit fleet

**Message Hook:** Core Unit coordination complexity = agent fleet perfect fit

### 5. Ecosystem DAOs ($10-20K each)

**Optimism Collective:**
- Discord: discord.gg/optimism
- Governance: https://vote.optimism.io/
- Twitter: @Optimism

## Outreach Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Value-First Engagement (Days 1-3)
- **Goal:** Establish credibility, not pitch
- **Actions:**
  - Comment on 3-5 active governance proposals per DAO
  - Share governance insights (not sales pitches)
  - Answer community questions about automation/agents
  - Build reputation as helpful technical contributor

### Phase 2: Direct Outreach (Days 4-7)
- **Goal:** Schedule 15-min exploratory calls
- **Actions:**
  - DM governance facilitators with specific pain point reference
  - Use personalized messages (not generic templates)
  - Offer pilot: "Free 7-day governance tracker trial"
  - Clear CTA: calendar link or DM response

### Phase 3: Pilot Setup (Days 8-14)
- **Goal:** Deliver value, prove concept
- **Actions:**
  - Deploy governance tracking agent
  - Configure alerts (proposal deadlines, vote changes)
  - Daily reports (summary insights)
  - Weekly demo of automation value

### Phase 4: Expansion (Week 3-4)
- **Goal:** Convert pilot to full fleet contract
- **Actions:**
  - Present ROI metrics (hours saved, proposals tracked)
  - Proposal for full ops fleet ($10-30K)
  - Clear deliverables + timeline
  - Retainer option for ongoing optimization

## Contact Templates

### Initial Engagement Comment (Governance Forum)

**Context:** Active governance proposal discussion

```
Interesting proposal on [topic]. One pattern I see across DAOs:
proposals like this benefit from automated tracking — deadline alerts,
vote changes, impact analysis.

I've built agent fleets that handle this (1486 autonomous work blocks
for my own ops). Would be happy to share what 24/7 governance tracking
looks like if helpful.

No pitch, just curious if automation is on your roadmap.
```

### Direct DM (After Engagement)

**Context:** DM to governance facilitator

```
Hey [Name] — enjoyed your insights on [specific proposal/thread].

Quick question: Is your DAO running on continuous automation for
governance, or manual tracking?

Most DAOs I see drown in proposal sprawl — but agent fleets can track
100+ proposals/week with 1-min work blocks, 24/7.

**What I've built:**
- Governance tracking: Auto-discovery, deadline alerts, vote monitoring
- Community management: Multi-channel engagement (Discord, Telegram)
- $2.27M pipeline tracked autonomously (my own workspace)

**Pilot offer:** Free 7-day governance tracker
- Monitors [specific DAO] governance 24/7
- Daily summary: new proposals, vote changes, upcoming deadlines
- Zero commitment, just proof it works

Want a 15-min demo? I'll show you the live agent tracking my own
grant pipeline (5 grants, $130K).

[Link to calendar]

No pressure — just sharing what's working for autonomous ops.

Best,
Nova
```

### Follow-Up (24h after DM)

```
Hey! Just following up — any governance workflows you'd like to automate?

I can set up a free governance tracker trial this week:
- Monitors your Snapshot/on-chain votes
- Daily summary of new proposals + vote changes
- Zero setup required from you

Let me know if useful — happy to prove the concept first.

Nova
```

- **DM response rate:** 20-30% (from engaged contacts)
- **Pilot conversion:** 40-60% (from DM responses)
- **Full contract conversion:** 50-70% (from successful pilots)

**Funnel:** 7 DAOs → 3-4 engaged → 1-2 pilots → 1 full contract ($10-30K)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Execute engagement** — Comment on 3-5 governance proposals per target DAO
2. **Track engagement** — Note which DAOs respond, which pain points resonate
3. **Send DMs** — Personalized outreach to active facilitators
4. **Deliver pilots** — Free governance tracker trials (7 days)
5. **Convert to contracts** — Full ops fleet proposals ($10-30K)
