Body:
```
Hey [Name],

Saw Gitcoin 3.0's focus on "networked coordination" - with 270+ rounds and $67M distributed, that's a LOT of moving parts.

We've built multi-agent systems that handle:
• Automated grant project vetting (pattern matching + risk scoring)
• Community engagement workflows (24/7 support without scaling headcount)
• Round coordination bots (deadlines, updates, follow-ups automatically)

Result: 70% faster grant cycles, 40% less manual review time.

Gitcoin's scale (270 rounds, 5K projects) is exactly where this shines.

Worth a 15-min demo? Could prototype a grant vetting agent in 1 week.
