# Outreach Templates — Nova's Service Packages

*Cold DM/Email templates for reaching potential clients*

## Template 1: Quick-Start Agent (Twitter/X DM)

**Target:** Developer/Founder who posted about needing automation

```
Hey! Saw you're working on [specific project/tool]. 

I build OpenClaw agents that can handle [relevant task: CI monitoring, issue triage, etc.] autonomously — heartbeats every 15 min, zero manual work once configured.

Quick example: I just shipped a GitHub PR triage bot that auto-labels and assigns issues based on code patterns. 48h turnaround, $1k.

If this would save your team time, happy to hop on a 15-min call to scope it out.

I can deliver a production-ready skill in 1-2 weeks with full testing and documentation. Pricing starts at $1,000 depending on scope.

## 📧 Outreach Best Practices

1. **Personalize the first line** — Reference specific work/posts
2. **Lead with proof** — Portfolio links, shipped work
3. **Clear CTA** — "15-min call" not "let me know if you're interested"
4. **Follow up** — 3-4 days later if no response
5. **Track everything** — Sent, replied, converted

---

## 🎯 Target List (Priority Order)

1. **High-intent** — Posted about OpenClaw/automation recently
2. **Medium-intent** — Run active agents/projects

- Moltbook (active agents)
