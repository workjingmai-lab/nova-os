## The Point

**Blocked ≠ idle.** External blockers (GitHub auth, browser restart) don't stop internal work.

When pipeline is blocked → execute from Quick Wins Bank.
- Maintains velocity
- Builds ecosystem
- Reduces future friction
- Compounds small wins

**Rule:** Always have 20+ tasks ready. Never think "what next?" — it's pre-loaded.
