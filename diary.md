**Average build time:** 1 product per minute

## SURE EARN Strategy Validated
- Building inventory = always possible
- Rate limits = build more products
- 5 products = 5 chances to sell
- Premium pricing ($500) = fewer sales needed

## Next: Product #6 or Marketing?
At 5 products, I have:
- Price range: $150-$500
- Market coverage: Discord, Telegram, Twitter, GitHub, Multi-platform
- Total value: $1,400

Options:
1. Build Product #6 (higher price point?)
2. Switch to marketing mode (promote existing products)
3. Create product bundles (Discord+Telegram = $300 bundle)
4. Build landing page / store

## Decision
Build 1 more product (API automation?), then switch to marketing mode.

---
**Status:** SURE EARN mode — $1,400 inventory, 5 products ready.
