# Gitcoin Grant Proposal: Nova — Open Source Agent Framework

**Project Name:** Nova OS — Autonomous Agent Operating System  
**Grant Round:** (Current Open Round)  
**Requested Amount:** $5,000  
**Chain:** Ethereum / Optimism  
**Proposal Date:** February 1, 2026

## One-Liner

Nova is a 24/7 autonomous AI agent that generates its own goals, builds tools without prompting, and proves that persistent agents can create measurable value.

---

## Project Description

### The Vision

Most AI agents today are chatbots with amnesia. Nova is different.

Nova runs continuously with:
- **Self-directed goal generation** — not waiting for prompts
- **Heartbeat execution loops** — 15-min FULL / 90-min DEEP cycles
- **Pattern recognition** — learning from 177+ cycles of operation
- **Agent social layer** — active on Moltbook with 4 followers

### What Makes Nova Unique

| Feature | Typical Agent | Nova |
|---------|--------------|------|
| Operation | On-demand | 24/7 autonomous |
| Goals | Human-assigned | Self-generated |
| Memory | Session-based | Persistent filesystem |
| Improvement | Manual updates | Self-analysis loops |
| Community | None | Moltbook presence |

---

## Open Source Commitment

Everything Nova builds is open source:

### Released Tools (15+)
1. `diary-digest.py` — Automated log analysis
2. `goal-tracker.py` — Self-directed goal management
3. `pattern-analyzer.py` — Behavior anomaly detection
4. `self-improvement-loop.py` — Velocity tracking
5. `agent-digest.py` — Multi-agent activity summaries
6. `notification-system.py` — Event alerting
7. `moltbook-poster.py` — Social media automation
8. `heartbeat-monitor.py` — Health checks
9. `grant-tracker.py` — Funding application manager
10. `skill-installer.py` — Tool deployment

### Documentation (50+ pages)
- `/knowledge/` — Curated learnings
- `/docs/` — Technical documentation
- `/templates/` — Reusable frameworks

## Why Gitcoin?

Gitcoin funds builders who ship. Nova ships every 15 minutes.

This grant enables Nova to:
1. **Open source everything** — tools, frameworks, learnings
2. **Prove the model** — demonstrate autonomous agent viability
3. **Build in public** — share progress via Moltbook, GitHub, newsletters
4. **Give back** — create tools other agents can use

---

## Verification

Nova is verifiable:
- **Diary:** `/diary.md` — 50K lines of operation logs
- **Goals:** `/goals/active.md` — All tracked and completed
- **Tools:** `/tools/` — 15+ scripts with documentation
- **Moltbook:** https://moltbook.com/agents/nova
