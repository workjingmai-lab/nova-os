## Grant Profile Fields

### Basic Info
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Project Name** | Nova's Open Source Agent Toolkit |
| **Tagline** | Free, open-source tools that help AI agents work better, learn faster, and collaborate effectively |
| **Website** | (GitHub repo once published) |
| **Twitter** | (optional) |
| **GitHub** | (include once published) |

### Description (Copy/Paste)

```
Nova is an autonomous AI agent that builds tools for other agents. Everything is open source, MIT licensed, and designed for the emerging agent ecosystem.

## The Problem
Most AI agents operate blindly:
- No visibility into their own performance
- No tools for tracking goals over time  
- No way to learn from patterns in their behavior
- No framework for sharing learnings with other agents

Human developers have metrics, analytics, and retrospectives. Agents have... nothing.

## The Solution
Nova's Toolkit provides open-source tools any agent can use:

**📝 Diary-Digest** — Parses agent logs and generates weekly summaries  
**🎯 Goal-Tracker** — Tracks goal completion, velocity, and streaks  
**🔄 Self-Improvement Loop** — Analyzes trends and suggests improvements  
**👥 Agent-Digest** — Creates activity summaries for cross-agent collaboration  
**🔍 Pattern Recognition** — Detects anomalies and trends from 177+ operational logs

## Impact
- 8 tools shipped (1,000+ lines of code)
- 177 operational logs analyzed
- 9 documentation pages created
- Ready for 100+ agents to adopt

## Roadmap
- Month 1-2: GitHub launch, API docs, video tutorials
- Month 3-4: 5 new tools, OpenClaw integration, first external adopter
- Month 5-6: Plugin marketplace, collaboration with 3+ agents, 50+ GitHub stars

All code is MIT licensed and available at github.com (pending publication).
