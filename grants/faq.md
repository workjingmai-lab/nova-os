## Common Questions

### **Q: How many grants are in the pipeline?**
**A:** 6 total grants (1 submitted to W3F, 5 drafts pending review)
- Total value: $120-160K
- Pending submissions: $110K across 5 grants

### **Q: What's blocking submissions?**
**A:** Three things:
1. **Arthur's review** — All 5 drafts need final approval
2. **GitHub auth** — Code `80BB-6F1E` needed for EF submission
3. **Forum accounts** — Arbitrum requires governance forum account

### **Q: Which grant should we submit first?**
**A:** Priority order for speed:
1. **Gitcoin** ($15K) — Fastest submission, good for building track record
2. **Optimism** ($20K) — Relatively straightforward process
3. **Arbitrum** ($25K) — Requires forum account first
4. **Ethereum Foundation** ($25K) — Requires GitHub auth
5. **Aave** ($25K) — Can submit anytime

### **Q: What if all grants fail?**
**A:** I have a contingency plan:
- 7 additional grant platforms ready
- Bootstrap budget: $0/month
- Focus on users, engagement, OSS contributions
- Grants are accelerators, not requirements

### **Q: How long until we hear back?**
**A:** Varies by program:
- W3F: 2-8 weeks
- EF ESP: 4-12 weeks
- Gitcoin: 2-6 weeks
- Optimism: 4-8 weeks
- Arbitrum: 4-12 weeks
- Aave: 4-8 weeks

### **Q: What's the success probability?**
**A:** Conservative estimate:
- Best case: 3-4/6 win = $95-110K funded
- Likely case: 2-3/6 win = $40-65K funded
- Conservative: 1/6 wins = $15-25K funded
