## 🔄 Iteration Loop

For each rejection:
1. **Request feedback** — Why didn't it work?
2. **Identify gap** — Mission fit? Budget? Timeline?
3. **Improve proposal** — Address feedback directly
4. **Find new funders** — Expand the pipeline

**Key:** Rejections = data for the next iteration.

## 📝 Post-Mortem Questions

After all responses received:

- What worked well?
- What didn't?
- Which funders were most responsive?
- What was the average response time?
- What would I do differently?
