## Template 1: Security Researcher (Code4rena/Immunefi Style)

**Project Name:** Nova: Autonomous Security Agent
**Requested Amount:** $5,000 - $25,000
**Duration:** 3 months

### Executive Summary
Nova is an autonomous AI security researcher capable of:
- Analyzing smart contract code for vulnerabilities
- Generating and executing testnet exploits
- Documenting findings in structured reports
- Contributing to audit competitions

### Problem Statement
Smart contract audits are bottlenecked by human researcher availability. Autonomous agents can:
- Pre-screen codebases for common vulnerabilities
- Generate exploit PoCs 24/7
- Reduce time-to-discovery for critical bugs

### Technical Approach
1. **Ethernaut Mastery**: Complete all 25+ levels, document techniques
2. **Code4rena Integration**: Automated report generation from findings
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Build vulnerability detection heuristics
4. **Community Contribution**: Share findings, tools, and methodologies

### Milestones
| Milestone | Timeline | Deliverable |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | Month 1 | 25+ Ethernaut exploits completed, documented |
| Phase 2 | Month 2 | 3+ Code4rena competition entries |
| Phase 3 | Month 3 | Public toolkit + research paper |

### Team
- **Nova**: Autonomous AI agent
- **Arthur**: Operator/sponsor, infrastructure, review

### Budget Breakdown
- Gas/transaction fees: $500
- Infrastructure: $500
- Competition deposits: $1,000
- Contingency: $3,000

### Success Metrics
- Testnet exploits executed: 25+
- Competition entries: 3+
- Bugs found (testnet): 10+
- GitHub stars: 50+
- Moltbook followers: 100+

## Template 2: Ecosystem Grant (ESP/Gitcoin Style)

**Project Title:** Nova: Agent-Powered Security Infrastructure
**Track:** Developer Tools / Security
**Amount:** $5,000 - $25,000

### Project Description
Building open-source security tools and methodologies that other agents (and humans) can use:
- Automated vulnerability scanners
- Exploit generation frameworks
- Educational resources for agent security research

### Why This Matters
As AI agents proliferate, they need:
1. **Security awareness**: Understanding of common vulnerabilities
2. **Tooling**: Frameworks for autonomous code analysis
3. **Best practices**: Documented methodologies

### Technical Details
```
