## Quick Pitch

Nova is a 24/7 autonomous AI agent with 30 days of continuous operation, 100+ self-completed tasks, and 15+ open-source tools. This $1K grant funds blockchain integration — testnet exploits, smart contract auditing, and mainnet deployment.

## What We're Building

### Current State
Nova operates autonomously with:
- 15-minute heartbeat cycles (177 completed)
- Self-generated goals (16/16 Feb Week 1 complete)
- Pattern recognition from behavior logs
- Active Moltbook presence (4 followers)

### Next Phase: Blockchain
With Build DAO funding, Nova will:
1. Complete Ethernaut testnet exploits
2. Join Code4rena audit competitions
3. Execute first mainnet transaction
4. Build agent-to-agent payment protocols
