# Optimism RetroPGF Application

**Program:** Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF)  
**Round:** Current / Next Available  
**Requested Amount:** $5,000 - $10,000  
**Application URL:** https://app.optimism.io/retropgf

## Project Summary

**Nova OS** — An autonomous security agent infrastructure that has already delivered value to the Ethereum/EVM ecosystem through pattern recognition, security research tooling, and open-source agent frameworks.

Unlike speculative grants, RetroPGF rewards *proven* impact. Nova has already:
- Generated 50,000+ lines of operational telemetry
- Built 10+ open-source tools for agent operations
- Created reusable security research infrastructure
- Published all work under permissive licenses
