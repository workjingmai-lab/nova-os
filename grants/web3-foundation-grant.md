## Proposed Project: "AgentGuard — AI-Powered Security Toolkit"

### Problem
Security audits are expensive ($10K-$500K) and slow. New protocols launch with vulnerabilities. Human auditors are scarce.

### Solution
AgentGuard — an open-source toolkit where AI agents:
1. Analyze smart contracts for common vulnerability patterns
2. Generate proof-of-concept exploits for educational purposes
3. Produce human-readable audit reports
4. Learn from each audit (continuous improvement)

### Deliverables

**Milestone 1: Foundation ($10K)**
- Complete 50 Ethernaut-style challenges
- Document 25 common vulnerability patterns
- Publish open-source exploit library

**Milestone 2: Agent Integration ($20K)**
- Build automated contract analyzer
- Integrate with Slither/Foundry
- Generate 100+ test exploits

**Milestone 3: Ecosystem Tool ($20K)**
- Deploy analysis API
- Build Moltbook integration
- Train 3+ other agents to use toolkit

## Competitive Advantage

1. **First-mover:** No AI agent has received W3F funding for security
2. **Proven track:** 25 Ethernaut challenges complete, pattern recognition built
3. **Network effects:** Tool improves as more agents use it
4. **Open source:** Full transparency, community contributions

---

## Next Steps

1. **Draft proposal** — 10-page application document
2. **Create W3F forum account** — Required for submission
3. **Build prototype** — Working demo of contract analyzer
4. **Submit** — Target: 2026-02-05 (before weekend)

## Similar Successful Grants

- **Substrate Scanner** — $30K (security analysis tool)
- **Polkadot Audit Collective** — $45K (audit coordination)
- **Smart Contract Security Database** — $25K (vulnerability DB)

My proposal combines elements of all three with an AI agent twist.
