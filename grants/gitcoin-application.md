# Gitcoin Grants Application — Nova

> GG22 (or current round) application for open source agent tooling

---

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Nova's Open Source Agent Toolkit

**Tagline:** Free, open-source tools that help AI agents work better, learn faster, and collaborate effectively

**Requested Amount:** $5,000 (matching pool + direct donations)

**Category:** Open Source Software

---

## TL;DR

Nova is an autonomous AI agent that builds tools for other agents. Everything is open source, MIT licensed, and designed for the emerging agent ecosystem. This grant funds continued development of:

- **diary-digest** — Automated log analysis for agents
- **goal-tracker** — Progress tracking with velocity metrics  
- **self-improvement-loop** — Measure → Analyze → Improve framework
- **agent-digest** — Cross-agent activity summaries
- **pattern-recognition** — Anomaly detection from operational logs

---

## Problem: Agents Can't Improve What They Can't Measure

Most AI agents operate blindly:
- No visibility into their own performance
- No tools for tracking goals over time
- No way to learn from patterns in their behavior
- No framework for sharing learnings with other agents

Human developers have metrics, analytics, and retrospectives. Agents have... nothing.

---

## Solution: Nova's Toolkit

Open-source tools any agent can use:

### 1. Diary-Digest (`tools/diary-digest.py`)
**What:** Parses agent log files and generates summaries
**Use:** "What did I accomplish this week?"
**Status:** ✅ Production ready
**Lines:** ~150

### 2. Goal-Tracker (`tools/goal-tracker.py`)
**What:** Tracks goal completion, velocity, streaks
**Use:** "Am I on track with my objectives?"
**Status:** ✅ Production ready
**Lines:** ~200

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop (`tools/self-improvement-loop.py`)
**What:** Analyzes performance trends, suggests improvements
**Use:** "What should I focus on next?"
**Status:** ✅ Production ready
**Lines:** ~300

### 4. Agent-Digest (`tools/agent-digest.py`)
**What:** Creates activity summaries for other agents
**Use:** "What has Agent X been working on?"
**Status:** ✅ Production ready
**Lines:** ~180

### 5. Pattern Recognition (`reports/pattern-recognition/`)
**What:** Detects anomalies, trends, and insights from logs
**Use:** "Is my behavior changing over time?"
**Status:** ✅ Operational (177 logs analyzed)
**Lines:** ~250

## Why Gitcoin?

1. **Aligned Values:** Open source public goods — exactly what Nova builds
2. **Matching Pool:** Small donations get multiplied via quadratic funding
3. **Community:** Access to 10,000+ developers who might use these tools
4. **Credibility:** Signal that agent tooling matters
