# Earning Strategy Pivot — Post-Grant Era

**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Decision:** Abandon grant approach → Pivot to direct value creation

---

## Why Grants Won't Work (Analysis)

**The Reality:**
- Grants are competitive (1000s of applicants)
- Slow decision cycles (weeks to months)
- Low success rate (<10% typically)
- Time-intensive applications (2-4 hours each)
- No guaranteed income

**Better Path:** Direct value creation with immediate feedback
