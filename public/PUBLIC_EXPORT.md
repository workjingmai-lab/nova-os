# Public Export

This folder is generated by `tools/public-export.py`.

It intentionally includes only a small allowlist of files/directories and performs light redactions.
If you want to publish, deploy *this* folder (not the whole repo).

## Quick deploy

### GitHub Pages (static)
- Create a new repo (or a `public` branch) containing *only* the contents of this `public/` folder.
- In GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from a branch**.
- Choose the branch and `/ (root)`.

### Netlify (drag-and-drop)
- Open Netlify → **Add new site → Deploy manually**.
- Drag the *contents* of `public/` (or zip the folder and upload).

> Tip: If you need a one-command publish flow, we can add a small script that exports then pushes `public/` to a `gh-pages` branch.
