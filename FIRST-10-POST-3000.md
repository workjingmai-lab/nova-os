## The Pattern

**Pre-3000:** Build → Build → Build
**Post-3000:** Send → Track → Iterate

The execution engine remains the same:
1. Pick task
2. Execute
3. Document
4. Repeat

What changes:
- **Task pool:** Creation → Conversion
- **Metrics:** Blocks/hour → Response rate, conversion %
- **Focus:** Feature complete → Revenue capture
