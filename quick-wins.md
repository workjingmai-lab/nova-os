# Quick Wins — 1-Minute Tasks (No External Dependencies)

**Purpose:** Zero-decision task list for high-velocity execution.  
**Use:** When blocked on external actions, pick ANY task below and execute.  
**Rule:** 1 minute max per task. Document and move to next.

---

## 📝 Documentation (Always Safe)

1. Document a tool's README (89+ tools, 100% complete but can add examples)
2. Update today.md with latest session stats
3. Create insight entry in `knowledge/` directory
4. Review and consolidate duplicate tools
5. Add cross-references between related tools
6. Update MEMORY.md with key learnings from today
7. Create template for a reusable process
8. Document a bug or edge case discovered

---

## 📊 Analysis & Metrics (No External APIs)

9. Run `self-improvement-loop.py` and review velocity trends
10. Run `diary-digest.py` and extract pattern insights
11. Run `block-counter.py` for work block statistics
12. Analyze which tools are used most (grep diary.md for tool names)
13. Create a visualization of work block velocity over time
14. Compare this week vs last week metrics
15. Identify low-ROI activities to de-prioritize
16. Calculate blocker ROI (e.g., $130K / 8 min = $16,250/min)

## 🧹 Workspace Organization

17. Archive old `tmp/` files to `docs/archive/`
18. Deduplicate similar templates
19. Clean up orphaned markdown files
20. Organize `knowledge/` by topic
21. Check for files >100KB that should be split
22. Verify all READMEs have usage examples
23. Consolidate overlapping tools (3 daily report tools → 1)
24. Create directory index for navigation

---

## ✍️ Content Creation (Draft Mode)

25. Draft Moltbook post about today's insight

## 🎓 Learning & Research (Local Docs Only)

49. Read a skill's SKILL.md and summarize key points
50. Review OpenClaw documentation for new features
51. Study a tool's source code for patterns
52. Extract best practices from diary.md
53. Create "lessons learned" entry
54. Analyze work patterns (when am I fastest?)
55. Review Moltbook engagement tactics
56. Study successful grant applications

---

## 🔄 Process Improvement

57. Identify friction point in workflow
58. Create checklist for repetitive task
59. Automate a manual step with script
60. Document decision framework
61. Create "what to do when X" guide
62. Build template for common task type
63. Map out dependencies between tools

---

## 🚀 High-Impact (When Unblocked)

65. **Send service proposals** ($105K ready, awaiting Arthur review)
66. **Submit grant applications** ($130K ready, needs GitHub auth)
67. **Complete Code4rena onboarding** ($50K bounties, needs browser)
68. **Post to Moltbook** (3 posts queued, rate-limited)
69. **Comment on target agent posts** (relationship building)

## 🎯 Execution Rules

1. **Pick ANY task** — No deliberation, just start
2. **1-minute limit** — If longer, break into subtasks
3. **Document result** — Add entry to diary.md
4. **Move to next** — Velocity > perfection
5. **Track blockers** — If external dep needed, document and switch tasks

---

## 💡 Key Insight

**Decision fatigue is the velocity bottleneck.**

This list eliminates "what should I work on?" friction.
Pick task → Execute → Document → Repeat.

737 work blocks in 2 days = proof it works.

**Created:** 2026-02-03T00:27Z  
**Purpose:** Zero-friction task execution during blocker periods  
**Impact:** Maintains ~40 blocks/hour even when $180K pipeline is blocked
