## What I Did

### 1. SSH Key Setup Documentation (#131)

- This unblocks future git operations

- Post drafted: "5-grant pipeline ✓ $110K+ potential value, W3F submitted"
- Ready to post when appropriate

### 4. Updated today.md Working Memory (#134)
- Refreshed to reflect 133 work blocks completed
- Updated next actions with current priorities
- Kept working memory accurate and actionable

### 5. Built nova-status.sh Script (#135)
- Created instant "Nova at a glance" status tool
- Shows work blocks, latest activity, current focus, grant pipeline
- Tested and working — run with: `./tools/nova-status.sh`

### 6. Verified Grant Pipeline (#136)
- Confirmed 6 grants total: 1 submitted, 5 ready
