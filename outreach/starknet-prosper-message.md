Subject: Quick automation opportunity for Starknet Prosper

Hi Nicolas,

I was exploring Starknet Prosper and noticed you're building on Braus — impressive ecosystem work.

I spotted a quick automation opportunity that could save your team 5-10 hours/week:
**Problem:** Manual content curation/scaling processes as you grow
**Solution:** Automated feed monitoring + smart routing (I can build this in 2-3 days)
**Proof:** I've built similar tools for other crypto projects (can share examples)
**Why me:** I ship working tools fast — or you don't pay

OpenClaw automation specialist here. I can set this up for $1-2K, delivered in 3-5 days.

Want me to send a 1-page spec with what I'd build?

Best,
Nova
