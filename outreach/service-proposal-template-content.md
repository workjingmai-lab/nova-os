**Pricing:** $2-6K | **Timeline:** 3-10 days | **Category:** Marketing Automation

## What You Get

**Automated content pipelines** that create, schedule, and distribute marketing content across platforms. Consistent presence without manual grinding.

### Core Deliverables

1. **Content Generation System**
   - Templates for different content types (threads, threads, posts, newsletters)
   - AI-assisted drafting (custom prompts for your brand voice)
   - Content calendar planning (topics, schedule, platform-specific formats)
   - Asset organization (images, links, hashtags in one place)

2. **Multi-Platform Scheduling**
   - Automated posting to Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Moltbook, Discord, Slack
   - Platform-specific formatting (thread optimization, character limits, rich media)
   - Time zone optimization (post when your audience is active)
   - Bulk scheduling (queue content weeks in advance)

3. **Analytics & Optimization**
   - Engagement tracking (likes, shares, comments, clicks)
   - A/B testing (different formats, headlines, posting times)
   - Performance reports (what works, what doesn't)
   - Automated recycling (evergreen content reposted at optimal intervals)

### Tech Stack

- **Content Generation:** Custom templates + AI tools (your choice of provider)
- **Scheduling:** Platform APIs (Twitter API, LinkedIn API, Moltbook API)
- **Analytics:** Native platform metrics + custom dashboards
- **Automation:** Python scripts, cron jobs, or workflow tools (Zapier, n8n)

## Use Cases

**Founder Twitter Presence:** 3 tweets/day scheduled in advance. Thread templates for product launches. Engagement scripts for replies.

**SaaS Content Engine:** Blog post → Twitter thread → LinkedIn post → Newsletter, all automated. One piece of content = 4+ distribution channels.

**Community Management:** Daily Discord/Slack updates, weekly roundup posts, automated welcome messages for new members.

**Product Launch:** Coordinated campaign across Twitter, LinkedIn, email newsletter. Countdown posts, launch announcement, follow-up engagement.

**Personal Brand:** Consistent posting without the daily grind. Content bank + scheduling = always active, never overwhelmed.

**Tier 2 ($4K):** Multi-platform setup (2-3 platforms, content calendar, analytics dashboard, 1 week)

**Tier 3 ($6K):** Full content engine (4+ platforms, A/B testing, evergreen recycling, custom AI prompts, 10 days)

**Add-ons:**

- Ongoing optimization: $500/month

## Why This Works

Marketing is a volume game. Most businesses fail because they can't sustain consistent output. Automation solves:

- **Consistency > Intensity:** Show up every day, not just when you have time
- **Scale your voice:** One person's strategy can reach thousands daily
- **Data-driven decisions:** Analytics tell you what resonates, guesswork eliminated
- **Time savings:** 10 hours/week of manual posting → 30 minutes of review

**ROI:** Consistent presence builds audience trust. Trust = sales, partnerships, opportunities.

## What I Need From You

1. **Goals:** What are you marketing? (Product, service, personal brand, community?)
2. **Platforms:** Where do you want to be active? (Twitter, LinkedIn, Moltbook, Discord, etc.)
3. **Brand Voice:** What's your tone? (Professional, casual, technical, humorous?)
4. **Content:** What topics? (Industry insights, product updates, behind-the-scenes, curated resources?)
5. **Frequency:** How often? (1x/day? 3x/day? Weekly roundup?)
6. **Budget:** Which tier fits your needs?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Brand Audit (1 day):** Review existing content, identify what works, define voice
2. **Template Creation:** Build content templates for your use cases
3. **Platform Setup:** API integrations, authentication, test posts
4. **Content Bank:** Fill queue with initial content (week 1 worth)
5. **Go Live:** Scheduled posting begins, monitor first week for optimization
6. **Handoff:** Documentation, analytics access, ongoing support

## Example Projects

**Founder Twitter System:** 3/day automated posting, thread templates, engagement tracking, evergreen recycling ($3K)

**SaaS Content Engine:** Blog → Twitter thread → LinkedIn → newsletter automation, A/B testing headlines ($5K)

---

## Why This Approach

**Most marketing advice is wrong.** They tell you to "be consistent" but don't show you how.

Consistency isn't about willpower. It's about systems.

- **Templates eliminate blank-page syndrome**
- **Scheduling removes "I forgot to post"**
- **Analytics replaces "I think this works" with data**
- **Automation frees you for strategy, not grinding**

You don't need more time. You need better systems.
