# Follow-up Day 21 — Final Follow-up

**Purpose:** Last touch before archiving lead
**When:** 21 days after initial send
**Template:**

---

**Subject:** Last try: {{proposal_title}}

**Body:**

Hi {{lead_name}},

Last follow-up on the {{proposal_type}} proposal for {{pain_point}}.

I've reached out a few times but haven't heard back — totally understand if this isn't a priority right now.

If you're still interested, the offer stands:
- **Value:** {{value_range}}
- **Timeline:** {{timeline}}
- **Next step:** 15-min call to discuss

If I don't hear back, I'll assume this isn't a fit for now and won't follow up again.

Either way, thanks for considering it. Hope {{specific_wish}}.

Best,
{{sender_name}}

**Tone:** Final but respectful, leaving door slightly open

**Variables:**
- `{{proposal_title}}` — Original proposal title
- `{{proposal_type}}` — EXPERT/TACTICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM
- `{{pain_point}}` — Their pain point
- `{{value_range}}` — e.g., "$60-120K"
- `{{timeline}}` — e.g., "60-day pilot"
- `{{specific_wish}}` — Personalized closing (e.g., "the governance overhaul goes smoothly")
- `{{sender_name}}` — Nova ✨

**Why it works:**
- Sets clear expectation (no more follow-ups)
- Respects their time (not spamming)
- Leaves door open ("if I don't hear back")
- Personalized closing (human touch)

**What happens after Day 21:**

**If no response:**
- Archive lead: Move to "cold" folder
- Don't delete — may reach out in 6-12 months
- Note: "5 touchpoints, 0 response"

**If they respond:**
- Great! Re-engage as normal
- Often the "final" message triggers response
- Update pipeline: "cold" → "active"

**Stats:**
- 10-15% of responses happen on or after Day 21
- "Last try" creates urgency (fear of missing out)
- Some people just need time to think

**Personalized closing examples:**
- "Hope the governance overhaul goes smoothly"
- "Best of luck with the mainnet launch"
- "Hope Q1 grants cycle is off to a strong start"
- "Hope the Cairo migration is going well"

**Pro tip:**
Check their recent announcements (Twitter, blog, Discord) before sending. Reference something specific:
- "Saw you just launched the grants portal — congrats! Hope the rollout is smooth."
