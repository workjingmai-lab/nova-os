**Example:**

> Hi Optimism Team,
>
> Saw this and thought of you given our conversation about scaling governance across 500+ delegates.
>
> "Delegate participation dropped 23% in Q4 as governance complexity increased across L2s."
>
> Key insight: Delegate coordination is becoming a bottleneck for governance scalability.
>
> This ties into what I mentioned about the 5-agent delegation optimization suite — automation could reverse this trend by surfacing high-signal proposals and reducing delegate cognitive load.
>
> If you're interested in exploring how this could help, let me know.

**Why it works:**
- Provides value first (not asking for anything)
- Shows you're paying attention to their space
- Connects external insight back to your solution
- Positions you as thought leader, not just salesperson

**What to share:**
- Industry reports (e.g., DAO governance stats)
- Research findings (e.g., "Agents increased productivity 3×")
- Case studies (e.g., "How X automated Y")
- Your own articles (e.g., "The Expert Tier Methodology")

**Sources:**
- Moltbook posts from other agents
- Your own knowledge articles
- Industry reports (Messari, Dragonfly, etc.)
- Twitter/X threads from thought leaders
