## Day 3 Follow-Up: Proof + Milestones
**Subject:** Re: [Organization] agent suite — Quick update

**Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my note about [suite name] for [org].

Quick update on progress since we last spoke:
- Built [specific milestone 1, e.g., "Ethereum Foundation R&D suite v1"]
- Validated [specific milestone 2, e.g., "protocol integration test"]
- Published [specific milestone 3, e.g., "case study on similar project"]

The 60-day pilot would deliver [specific outcome, e.g., "5 agents automating 80% of grant tracking"].

Still interested in exploring this? If so, I can share a detailed pilot plan.

Best,
Nova
OpenClaw Architect

P.S. If you're not the right person for this, could you point me to who handles [department] initiatives?
```

**Key elements:**
- Proof of progress (not just "checking in")
- Specific milestones since last contact
- Clear next step (pilot plan)
- graceful escalation if wrong person

## Day 7 Follow-Up: Social Proof + Urgency
**Subject:** Re: [Organization] agent suite — Similar to [competitor/peer]

**Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Quick note: I just closed a similar engagement with [similar org or peer institution].

Their challenge was [specific pain point]. We deployed [suite size]-agent system and saw [specific result, e.g., "70% reduction in manual review time"] within [timeframe].

Your situation is different (you're focused on [their focus]), but the core tech stack applies.

The pilot is still available if you'd like to explore it. May I send over a custom proposal for [org]?

Best,
Nova

P.S. Here's the case study if you're curious: [link]
```

**Key elements:**
- Social proof (similar orgs working with you)
- Specific results (numbers build trust)
- Customization (not cookie-cutter)
- Optional case study (non-intrusive value)

## Day 14 Follow-Up: Value + New Angle
**Subject:** Re: [Organization] agent suite — Different approach

**Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

I've been thinking about [org]'s situation and realized I may have led with the wrong solution.

Instead of [original pitch], what if we started smaller?

**Option A:** [Smaller scope, e.g., "Single agent: Grant Tracker only"]
- Timeline: 2 weeks to deploy
- Investment: $15-20K pilot
- Outcome: [Specific result, e.g., "Automate 90% of grant application tracking"]

**Option B:** [Original scope, e.g., "Full 6-agent ecosystem suite"]
- Timeline: 60 days
- Investment: $75-150K pilot
- Outcome: [Full transformation]

Which feels like the right starting point? Or is there a different challenge you'd like to explore?

Best,
Nova
```

**Key elements:**
- Admission of possible misalignment (shows flexibility)
- Smaller option (reduces friction)
- Clear A/B choice (decision-making aid)
- Open-ended alternative (invites input)

## Day 21 Follow-Up: Final Value + Break
**Subject:** Re: [Organization] agent suite — Last note

**Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

This is my last follow-up on [org] agent suite — I don't want to clutter your inbox.

**Why I think this matters:**
- [Org] is doing [important work]
- Agent automation can [specific benefit, e.g., "free up 20+ hours/week for your team"]
- The pilot is [timeline] to prove value before larger commitment

**No pressure:**
If now's not the right time, I get it. [Org] will keep doing great work with or without me.

But if you ever want to explore agent automation, I'm here.

**If we don't connect:**
I'll close this thread. Feel free to reach out if circumstances change.

Best of luck with [current initiative],
Nova

P.S. One resource: [Link to relevant article/tool]. No signup required.
```

**Key elements:**
- Respectful "last call" (builds trust)
- Clear value prop (why this matters)
- No pressure (honors their autonomy)
- Useful resource (value with no ask)
- Clean break (professional closure)

## Day 30 Follow-Up: Long-Term Nurture
**Only if they engaged (replied, clicked, asked questions)**

**Subject:** Thinking of [org] — [Resource]

**Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Saw this [article/tool/development] and thought of you given our conversation about [topic].

[Context + why it matters to them]

No ask — just thought it might be useful.

Hope [current initiative] is going well!

Best,
Nova
```

**Key elements:**
- Relevant value (shows you're paying attention)
- No ask (pure nurture, not sales)
- Personalized (specific to their context)
- Light touch (not another "check-in")

## Follow-Up Strategy Notes

**When to stop:**
- 5 touches max (Day 0/3/7/14/21)
- Unless they engage (reply, click, ask) → then continue until decision
- After Day 21, close thread and move to long-term nurture (Day 30+)

**Response handling:**
- Positive ("Yes, send details") → Send pilot plan immediately
- Interested but busy ("Not now, maybe Q2") → Schedule follow-up in calendar
- Wrong person ("Talk to Sarah") → Get Sarah's info + warm intro
- Negative ("Not interested") → Ask why (data for improvement) + close gracefully

**Customization:**
- Always reference previous conversations
- Use specific org context (their challenges, goals, initiatives)
- Mention progress since last contact (builds credibility)
- Adjust tone to their communication style (formal vs casual)

**Metrics to track:**
- Response rate by touch (Day 3/7/14/21)
- Conversion rate (pilot started / total reached)
- Time to response (avg days)
- Reason for "not interested" (pattern analysis)

---

**Tools:**
- follow-up-tracker.py (track sent messages + schedule follow-ups)
- SEND-EVERYTHING.md (batch send + tracker integration)
- FOLLOW-UP-QUICK-REF.md (quick command reference)

**Pipeline:** $660-1,220K EXPERT tier → Target 20% conversion = $132-244K pilots started
