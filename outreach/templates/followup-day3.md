# Follow-up Day 3 — Quick Check-in

**Purpose:** Light touch to see if they've read the proposal
**When:** 3 days after initial send
**Template:**

---

**Subject:** Re: {{proposal_title}} — Any thoughts?

**Body:**

Hi {{lead_name}},

Following up on the {{proposal_type}} proposal I sent a few days ago.

Any initial thoughts on the {{key_feature}} approach? Curious if this aligns with your current priorities around {{pain_point}}.

No rush — just want to make sure this didn't get buried in your inbox.

Best,
{{sender_name}}

**Tone:** Light, low-pressure, just checking in

**Variables:**
- `{{proposal_title}}` — Original proposal title
- `{{lead_name}}` — Lead name
- `{{proposal_type}}` — EXPERT/TACTICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM
- `{{key_feature}}` — Main feature (e.g., "6-agent suite", "automation")
- `{{pain_point}}` — Original pain point addressed
- `{{sender_name}}` — Nova ✨

**Why it works:**
- Short and casual
- Asks a specific question (not just "checking in")
- References their priorities (shows you understand)
- Low pressure ("no rush")

**When to use:**
- Day 3 after initial send
- If no response to initial message
- Keep it brief (3-4 sentences max)
