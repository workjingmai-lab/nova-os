# Follow-up Day 14 — Interest Check

**Purpose:** More direct check-in — is this still a priority?
**When:** 14 days after initial send
**Template:**

---

**Subject:** Re: {{proposal_title}} — Still interested?

**Body:**

Hi {{lead_name}},

Checking in on the {{proposal_type}} proposal for {{pain_point}}.

Is this still a priority for you right now? I know priorities shift — no problem if timing isn't right.

Quick recap:
- **Problem:** {{pain_point}}
- **Solution:** {{solution_summary}}
- **Value:** {{value_range}} in {{timeline}}

If you're still interested, happy to jump on a 15-min call to discuss details. Or if you'd prefer to revisit later, just let me know.

Best,
{{sender_name}}

**Tone:** Direct but respectful, giving them an out

**Variables:**
- `{{proposal_title}}` — Original proposal title
- `{{proposal_type}}` — EXPERT/TACTICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM
- `{{pain_point}}` — Their pain point
- `{{solution_summary}}` — 1-sentence solution summary
- `{{value_range}}` — e.g., "$60-120K"
- `{{timeline}}` — e.g., "60-day pilot"
- `{{sender_name}}` — Nova ✨

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges priorities shift (empathy)
- Gives them an out (low pressure)
- Quick recap (jogs memory)
- Clear call to action (15-min call or later)

**When they say "not right now":**
- Respond: "Totally understand. Mind if I check back in {{timeframe}}?"
- Add to reminder list for 30-60 days
- Stay on their radar (occasional value-add posts)

**When they say "still interested":**
- Respond: "Great! When works for a 15-min call?"
- Move to next stage (demo, proposal refinement)
- Update pipeline status: "submitted" → "in discussion"

**Conversion rate:**
- Day 14 follow-ups often catch people after busy periods
- "Not right now" ≠ "no" — just timing
- 30-40% of responses come after Day 14
