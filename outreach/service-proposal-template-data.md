# Service Proposal: Data Pipeline & Analytics Automation

**Pricing:** $2-5K | **Timeline:** 3-7 days | **Category:** Data Engineering

---

## What You Get

**Automated data pipelines** that collect, transform, and deliver insights without manual intervention.

### Core Deliverables

1. **Data Collection System**
   - Automated data ingestion from multiple sources (APIs, databases, webhooks)
   - Scheduled scraping/extraction (hourly, daily, real-time)
   - Error handling and retry logic for reliability

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Cleaning and normalization (deduplication, validation, formatting)
   - Transformation logic (aggregations, filters, computations)
   - Storage layer (database, data warehouse, or flat files)

3. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Automated reporting (daily/weekly summaries via email/slack)
   - Custom dashboards (Grafana, Metabase, or custom web UI)
   - Alert system for anomalies or threshold breaches
   - Export capabilities (CSV, JSON, or API access)

### Tech Stack

- **Data Collection:** Python scripts, Airflow/Prefect for orchestration
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, or cloud storage (S3)
- **Visualization:** Grafana, Metabase, or custom dashboards
- **Alerting:** Email, Slack webhooks, or custom notifications

## Use Cases

**Business Metrics:** Track KPIs, revenue, user growth, conversion rates automatically. Daily reports to your inbox.

**Social Media Monitoring:** Track mentions, engagement, sentiment across platforms. Alert on spikes or trends.

**API Aggregation:** Combine data from multiple APIs into one unified view (e.g., crypto prices across exchanges, SaaS metrics across tools).

**Log Analysis:** Process server/app logs, extract insights, alert on error spikes or performance issues.

**Market Research:** Scrape pricing, product listings, reviews. Competitive intelligence on autopilot.

## Pricing Options

**Tier 1 ($2K):** Simple single-source pipeline (e.g., daily API fetch → database → email report)

**Tier 2 ($3.5K):** Multi-source aggregation + basic dashboard (2-3 data sources, scheduled reports)

**Tier 3 ($5K):** Full pipeline with custom dashboard + alerts (5+ sources, real-time monitoring, anomaly detection)

**Add-ons:**
- Additional data sources: +$500 per source
- Real-time streaming: +$1K
- Ongoing maintenance: $500/month

## Why This Works

Data is useless if you can't access it. Automating your data pipeline means:

- **Never miss insights:** Data collected and processed automatically, no manual fetching
- **Consistent quality:** Automated cleaning = reliable data, no human errors
- **Scale effortlessly:** Add new sources without rethinking the whole system
- **Faster decisions:** Reports and alerts mean you see what matters immediately

## What I Need From You

1. **Data Sources:** What data do you need? (APIs, databases, websites)
2. **Goals:** What questions are you answering? (e.g., "How's user growth trending?")
3. **Volume:** How much data? (MBs/day, GBs/day, streaming vs batch)
4. **Frequency:** Real-time, hourly, daily, weekly?
5. **Output:** Reports (email/Slack), dashboard, database, or API?
6. **Budget:** Which tier fits your needs?
