# Optimism DevEx Automation Outreach

**Target:** Optimism Foundation
**Potential:** $30K (OpenClaw Setup + Multi-Agent System)
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Work Block:** 2635

## Research

Optimism is a leading Ethereum L2 with $1B+ TVL and 500+ dApps. Their Developer Advocacy team manages:
- OP Mainnet and OP Stack documentation (2 distinct offerings)
- OP Stack chains documentation (Base, Zora, Mode, 50+ other chains using OP Stack)
- RetroPGF funding rounds (hundreds of grantees, complex impact evaluation)
- Governance and citizenship education
- Smart contract deployment and security guides

**Pain Point Identified:** OP Stack creates unique DevEx challenge — 50+ chains using the same tech but different deployments. DevEx team needs to maintain ecosystem-wide documentation while supporting chain-specific questions.

## Solution

Multi-agent automation system for OP Stack ecosystem DevEx:

**1. OP Stack Documentation Agent**
- One source of truth → auto-generate chain-specific guides
- Track chain-specific differences (block time, gas limits, features)
- Update all chain docs when OP Stack upgrades

**2. RetroPGF Impact Agent**
- Analyze grantee impact across 200+ RetroPGF recipients
- Automated impact reports (on-chain metrics, user growth, TVL)
- Flag high-impact projects for follow-up
- Generate RPGF scoring insights

**3. Migration + Deployment Agent**
- Auto-generate Optimism deployment guides from Ethereum codebases
- Estimate gas savings and L2 performance
- Identify Optimism-specific optimizations
- Create OP Stack chain deployment guides

**4. Support Agent**
- Answer 24/7: "How do I deploy?", "OP Stack vs OP Mainnet?", "RetroPGF criteria?"
- Troubleshoot deployment issues (bedrock upgrades, bridge issues)
- Route chain-specific questions (Base, Zora, etc.)

**Value Proposition:** Support 1 mainnet + 50+ OP Stack chains with minimal overhead. Template-based generation + chain-specific variations = scalable ecosystem DevEx.

## Message

**Subject:** Optimism DevEx: 1 chain, 50+ OP Stack rollups

Hey team —

Optimism's ecosystem is unique: OP Mainnet + 50+ chains using OP Stack (Base, Zora, Mode, and growing).

Your Developer Advocacy team is doing incredible work — but I see a scaling challenge: maintaining documentation for 1 mainnet + 50+ ecosystem chains, each with slightly different deployments, features, and communities.

I build multi-agent automation systems for ecosystem DevEx teams. For Optimism, this could look like:

**1. OP Stack Documentation Agent**
- One source of truth → auto-generate chain-specific guides
- Track chain differences (block time, gas limits, custom features)
- Update all chain docs when OP Stack upgrades

**2. RetroPGF Impact Agent**
- Analyze impact across 200+ RetroPGF recipients
- Automated impact reports (on-chain metrics, user growth, TVL)
- Flag high-impact projects for follow-up

**3. Migration + Deployment Agent**
- Auto-generate Optimism deployment guides from Ethereum codebases
- Estimate gas savings and L2 performance
- OP Stack chain deployment guides (launch your own rollup)

**4. 24/7 Support Agent**
- FAQs: "How do I deploy?", "OP Stack vs Mainnet?", "RetroPGF criteria?"
- Troubleshoot bedrock upgrades and bridge issues
- Route chain-specific questions (Base, Zora, etc.)

**ROI:** Support 1 mainnet + 50+ ecosystem chains with minimal overhead. Template-based generation + chain-specific variations = scalable ecosystem DevEx. Setup in 2-3 weeks.

This would be custom-built for Optimism's OP Stack and governance model. Not a generic tool — a system that learns Optimism.

Worth exploring with a quick call?
