# Polygon DevEx Automation Outreach

**Target:** Polygon Labs
**Potential:** $30K (OpenClaw Setup + Multi-Agent System)
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Work Block:** 2632

## Research

Polygon operates a multi-chain ecosystem (Polygon PoS, zkEVM, Miden, CDK) supporting 50K+ dApps and 300M+ addresses. Their DevRel/Developer Relations team handles:
- Multi-chain documentation (different guides for each chain)
- Grant program management (hundreds of grantees)
- Hackathon support and mentorship
- Integration guides for dApps migrating to Polygon
- Community support across Discord, Telegram, Forum

**Pain Point Identified:** Multi-chain complexity creates massive documentation and support overhead. Each chain has different RPC endpoints, transaction formats, gas mechanics, and tooling. DevEx team constantly duplicates work across chains.

## Solution

Multi-agent automation system designed for multi-chain DevEx operations:

**1. Chain-Agnostic Documentation Agent**
- Auto-generate chain-specific guides from a single source of truth
- Flag chain-specific differences (gas calculation on zkEVM vs PoS)
- Update all chain docs when a feature changes

**2. Grant Program Agent**
- Track grant milestones across 200+ grantees
- Automated check-ins and progress reports
- Flag at-risk projects early
- Generate grant performance analytics

**3. Migration Agent**
- Auto-generate migration guides for dApps coming from Ethereum/L2s
- Estimate gas cost savings and performance improvements
- Create code comparison examples (EVM vs zkEVM)

**4. Support Agent (Multi-Chain)**
- Answer chain-specific FAQs 24/7 ("Which chain should I use?", "zkEVM vs PoS?", "Gas fees?")
- Escalate technical issues to appropriate team
- Learn from each interaction to improve

**Value Proposition:** Reduce multi-chain DevEx overhead by 60%. Instead of manually maintaining 5x documentation sets, one source of truth with automated chain-specific variations.

## Message

**Subject:** Polygon DevEx: Multi-chain automation without the overhead

Hey team —

Polygon's ecosystem is massive: 50K+ dApps, 300M+ addresses, and now 4+ distinct chains (PoS, zkEVM, Miden, CDK).

Your DevRel team is crushing it — but I see a scaling problem: every new chain multiplies the documentation and support overhead. Maintaining separate guides, FAQs, and migration paths for PoS vs zkEVM vs CDK is a full-time job by itself.

I build multi-agent automation systems for multi-chain DevEx teams. For Polygon, this could look like:

**1. Chain-Agnostic Documentation Agent**
- One source of truth → auto-generate chain-specific guides
- Highlight chain differences (gas mechanics on zkEVM vs PoS)
- Update all chain docs when features change

**2. Grant Program Agent**
- Track milestones across 200+ grantees automatically
- Flag at-risk projects early
- Generate grant performance dashboards

**3. Migration Agent**
- Auto-generate migration guides (Ethereum → Polygon PoS/zkEVM)
- Estimate gas savings and performance improvements
- Code comparison examples for developers

**4. Multi-Chain Support Agent**
- Answer 24/7: "Which chain should I build on?"
- Chain-specific troubleshooting (bridge issues, gas estimation)
- Escalate edge cases to human DevEx

**ROI:** 60% reduction in multi-chain DevEx overhead. Setup in 2-3 weeks, scales infinitely with new chains.

I'd design this around Polygon's specific tech stack and workflows. Not a generic tool — a system that learns Polygon's ecosystem.

Worth a quick call to explore what's possible?

Best,
