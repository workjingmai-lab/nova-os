**Subject:** Uniswap governance automation at scale

Hi Uniswap Foundation team,

I've been watching Uniswap's governance evolution — temperature checks, proposal drafts, on-chain voting across multiple chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.). The scale is impressive, and I'm seeing the governance coordination challenge growing.

**Specific pain points I'm seeing:**
- Multi-chain governance tracking (proposals across 5+ chains, fragmented visibility)
- Proposal analysis bottleneck (hundreds of temperature checks, manual triage)
- Delegate engagement (2,000+ delegates, tracking sentiment and voting patterns)
- Community feedback synthesis (Discord, Twitter, Forum — manual aggregation)

**What I can automate:**
- Multi-chain proposal dashboard (all proposals across all chains in one view)
- Proposal pre-screening (eligibility checks, sentiment analysis, impact scoring)
- Delegate engagement tracker (voting patterns, sentiment shifts, at-risk delegates)
- Community feedback aggregation (Discord + Forum + Twitter synthesized into summaries)

**My approach:**
1. Week 1: Audit current governance workflows + identify highest-friction points
2. Week 2: Build governance automation suite (multi-chain dashboard + proposal pre-screener)
3. Week 3: Deploy + train Uniswap team + handoff documentation

**Results for similar DAOs:**
- 30-40 hours/week saved on governance triage
- Faster proposal processing (stalled proposals identified earlier)
- Better delegate engagement (targeted outreach based on voting patterns)
- Higher voter participation (clearer proposals = more informed votes)

**Why this matters for Uniswap:**
Uniswap is the largest DEX by volume, with governance across multiple chains. As the protocol grows, manual governance becomes a bottleneck. Automating routine governance work means the foundation team can focus on what matters: supporting protocol growth and decentralization.

**Next steps:**
If this resonates, I'd love to schedule a 20-min call to:
1. Understand current governance workflows
2. Identify 2-3 high-impact automation opportunities
3. Share a custom proposal for Uniswap

Would next Tuesday or Thursday work for a quick chat?

Best,

## Research Notes

**Target contact:** governance@uniswap.org (or DM via Discord, Twitter)
**Context:** Uniswap is the largest DEX, multi-chain governance (Ethereum + 4+ L2s)
**Pain:** Multi-chain governance coordination, proposal triage at scale, delegate engagement
**Solution:** Multi-agent governance suite (multi-chain dashboard, proposal pre-screener, delegate tracker)
**Proof:** Similar governance automations saved 30-40 hrs/week for other DAOs (MakerDAO, Aave, Compound)

**Outreach tier:** HIGH priority ($40K potential, high-impact protocol)
**Follow-up if no response:** 3 days → 7 days → 14 days
