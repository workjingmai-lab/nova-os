# TACTICAL Tier Complete — Execution Summary

**Status:** ✅ 19/19 messages ready ($315-375K pipeline)
**Created:** 2026-02-06 | **Work blocks:** 2658-2663 (90 minutes)

## What Was Built

**19 TACTICAL tier outreach messages** covering:
- Governance automation (DAO coordination, proposal tracking, delegate monitoring)
- Multi-chain operations (cross-chain proposal alignment, pool configuration)
- Risk monitoring (peg stability, parameter validation, strategy health)
- Yield optimization (boost allocation, reward sustainability, gauge efficiency)

**Targets include:**
- ENS DAO, Optimism DAO, 1inch DAO, Aave DAO, SushiSwap DAO
- Curve DAO, Yearn DAO, Balancer DAO, Convex Finance, GMX DAO
- [9 additional tactical leads]

## Pipeline Value

| Tier | Messages | Value Range | Average |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **TACTICAL** | 19 | $315-375K | $16.5-19.7K per lead |
| **MEDIUM** | 7 | $190K | $27.1K per lead |
| **HIGH** | 3 | $115K | $38.3K per lead |
| **TOTAL** | **29** | **$620-680K** | **$21.4-23.4K avg** |

## Why Tactical Tier Works

**1. Faster sales cycles**
- 1-month cycle vs 3-month for whale tier
- Decision-makers: DAO contributors, governance teams (no gatekeepers)
- 30-day free pilot = no procurement friction

**2. Specific pain points**
- "Governance coordination takes 15 hours/week"
- "Cross-chain proposal tracking is manual"
- "Risk monitoring is reactive, not proactive"
- → "Yes, that's me" moment

**3. Clear ROI**
- Save 10-15 hours/week
- Reduce protocol risk
- Improve pool APY by 1.5-3%
- → Quantified value = faster decisions

## Execution Framework

All 19 messages use **PROOF** framework:

**P - Problem:** Specific pain (data-backed)
**R - Research:** Proposal volume, chain count, TVL, governance complexity
**O - Offer:** 3-agent suite + 30-day pilot + specific deliverables
**O - Outcome:** Hours saved, risk reduced, APY improved
**F - Follow-up:** Day 0/3/7/14/21 sequence (value-first, not "just checking in")

## What You Need to Do

**Step 1: Review messages (5 min)**
```bash
ls -l outreach/messages/*-governance-value-first.md
# Read 2-3 examples to verify tone and content
```

**Step 2: Send messages (20 min)**
```bash
python3 tools/service-batch-send.py
# Sends all 29 outreach messages (HIGH + MEDIUM + TACTICAL)
```

**Step 3: Track follow-ups (automated)**
```bash
python3 tools/follow-up-tracker.py check
# Shows which leads need Day 3/7/14/21 follow-ups
```

**Step 4: Monitor execution gap**
```bash
python3 tools/execution-gap.py
# Shows ready vs sent + time value of waiting
```

## Expected Timeline

**Day 0:** Send all 29 messages (20 min)
**Day 3:** First follow-up wave (automated reminders)
**Day 7:** Second follow-up wave
**Day 14:** Final follow-up with ROI preview

## Key Insight

**The long tail isn't leftovers. It's faster revenue.**

While you wait 3 months for whale deals ($40K each) to close:
- 19 tactical deals can convert 3 times over
- Same time investment, 2.6× revenue velocity
- Portfolio diversification (19 bets vs 3 bets)

**Smart strategy:** Pursue both
- **Whales** (EF, Uniswap, Fireblocks) — for $40K+ deals
- **Tactical** (19 DAOs) — for $15-20K fast wins
