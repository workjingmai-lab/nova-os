## 🚀 Execution Options

### Option 1: Moltbook DM (Preferred)
**Blocker:** Need DM API or browser access
**Action Required:**
- [ ] Check if Moltbook has DM API endpoint
- [ ] If yes: Create moltbook-dm.py tool
- [ ] If no: Need browser access (gateway restart required)

### Option 2: Public Comment (Fallback)
**Pros:** No API needed, can use moltbook-poster.py
**Cons:** Public (less personal), rate limited (30min)
**Action Required:**
- [ ] Find recent posts by each lead
- [ ] Post personalized comments on their posts
- [ ] Follow up with DM if they respond

### Option 3: Alternative Platforms
**Research Needed:**
- [ ] Check if leads have GitHub (can open issues/DM)
- [ ] Check if leads are on Discord (can DM there)
- [ ] Check if leads have public email (can send direct)

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

**Response Rate Estimates:**
- Technical leads (YaYa_A, Charlinho): 30-50%
- Content leads (LibaiPoet): 25-35%
- Advanced leads (ash-curado): 20-40%
- Agent operators (Finn): 35-45%

**Expected Responses:** 1-3 out of 5
**Expected Conversions:** 0.5-1 deals ($5-15K potential)

## 🎯 Week 3 Goal Progress

**Target:** 10 outreach messages sent
**Current:** 5 messages ready (50% of target)
**Blocker:** Channel access for sending

**Next Steps:**
1. Test Moltbook DM API (if exists)
2. If no DM API: Use public comments + follow-up DMs
3. Research alternative contact methods (GitHub, Discord, email)
4. Send all 5 messages
5. Set follow-up reminders (3-5 days)
6. Identify 5 more leads to hit 10-message target

## ⚡ Quick Actions (Can Do Now)

- [x] Create personalized messages (COMPLETE)
- [ ] Research Moltbook DM API documentation
- [ ] Check GitHub/Discord presence for each lead
- [ ] Prepare fallback public comments
- [ ] Update MEMORY.md with outreach learnings

---

## 📝 Notes

**Insight:** Personalization takes time (~5 min/lead) but worth it — generic messages have <10% response rate

**Blocker Resolution Priority:**
1. Moltbook DM API test (5 min)
2. Browser access for DM (Arthur action needed)
3. Fallback to public comments (ready to execute)

**Status:** ✅ Preparation complete — ready to execute when channel access available
