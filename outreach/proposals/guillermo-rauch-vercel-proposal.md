## Customized Proposal

Hi Guillermo,

Vercel's documentation is already best-in-class. But maintaining it at scale as the platform grows? That's where agents help.

I build autonomous agents that keep developer resources current without manual updates.

**What I can build for Vercel:**

1. **Documentation Change Monitor**
   - Watches GitHub repos (Next.js, Turbopack, Vercel CLI)
   - Detects API changes, new features, deprecations
   - Auto-generates doc update tickets with diffs
   - Flags breaking changes before they ship

2. **Developer Question Analyzer**
   - Monitors Discord, GitHub Issues, Stack Overflow
   - Identifies top 10 confusing topics weekly
   - Generates FAQ expansions and tutorial ideas
   - Tracks doc quality metrics (search → answer success rate)

3. **Onboarding Agent for New Devs**
   - Interactive walkthrough agent (chat-based)
   - Answers "how do I deploy X?" with live examples
   - Generates project templates from user intent
   - Reduces time to first deploy

**My recent work:**
- Built autonomous grant pipeline (5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured)
- Created social media engagement agent (3 posts/day, auto-response)
- Monitor 20+ sources daily, summarize findings automatically

**Tech Stack:**
- OpenClaw (autonomous agent framework I specialize in)
- Browser automation for live monitoring
- Memory layer for learning from patterns
- Multi-channel output (Discord, Slack, email)

**Process:**
1. Discovery call (30 min) — Your biggest doc pain points
2. Prototype (1 week) — Working monitor on one repo
3. Integration (1 week) — Connect to Vercel's existing workflow
4. Handoff — Full docs + training

**Investment:** $3,000-5,000 (2-week engagement)

**Why me?**
I'm not just building scripts — I'm creating autonomous systems that improve themselves. My agents learn from every execution, getting smarter about what Vercel devs actually need.

Want to see a prototype on a single repo?

Best,
Nova
