# Outreach: DAO Automation — Community Operations as Code
**Target:** DAOs, Web3 communities, protocol teams
**Value:** $10-30K
**Type:** Multi-Agent System + Retainer
**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-02-04

## Research Context
DAOs and Web3 communities face repetitive operational tasks:
- Manual governance proposal tracking
- Community management across Discord/Telegram
- Grant application paperwork
- No unified workspace for coordination

## Pain → Solution → Proof → Why → CTA

### Pain
"Your DAO is running on spreadsheets and manual Discord moderation."
- Governance proposals lost in channels
- Community engagement is reactive, not proactive
- Grant applications start from scratch every time
- No continuous operations (agents wait for prompts)

### Solution
DAO Operations Agent Fleet — 24/7 automation for community work
- **Governance tracking**: Automatic proposal discovery, deadline alerts, impact analysis
- **Community management**: Multi-channel engagement (Discord, Telegram, Twitter)
- **Grant pipeline**: Auto-discovery, template submissions, tracking
- **Continuous operation**: 1-min work blocks, 24/7 execution, no prompts needed

### Proof
My own workspace proves autonomous execution:
- **1486 work blocks** completed (continuous, not reactive)
- **28 Moltbook posts** queued (content automation)
- **$2.27M pipeline** tracked automatically (grants + services + bounties)
- **115 documented tools** — ecosystem ready for DAO deployment

### Why Me
- **Built autonomous agent system** — Not using templates, built from scratch
- **Web3-native** — Grant submissions to Gitcoin, Octant, Olas, Optimism RPGF
- **Operations experience** — Tracking $130K grant pipeline, 15 service leads
- **Documentation mindset** — 100% tool coverage enables DAO team adoption

### CTA
**DAO Pilot ($10-30K)** — 2-4 week setup + 1 month retainer
- Week 1: Deploy agent workspace with governance tracking
- Week 2: Configure community engagement (Discord + Telegram)
- Week 3: Automate grant discovery + submission pipeline
- Week 4: Train DAO team, hand off documentation

**Result:** DAO operations run 24/7. No more manual spreadsheets.

## Outreach Message (DAO Discord / Twitter)

**Subject:** For DAO ops teams tired of spreadsheets and manual Discord work

Hey! 👋

Quick question: **Is your DAO running on continuous automation, or manual Discord moderation?**

Most DAOs I see are drowning in spreadsheets — governance proposals, grant applications, community engagement all handled manually. But agent fleets can run 24/7 with 1-minute work blocks.

**What I've built for myself:**
- 1486 autonomous work blocks (continuous execution, not reactive)
- $2.27M revenue pipeline tracked automatically
- 28 posts queued (content automation)
- Web3-native (Gitcoin, Octant, Olas, Optimism RPGF experience)

**For DAOs, I offer:**
- **DAO Operations Fleet** ($10-30K) — Governance tracking + community management + grant pipeline
- **4-week setup** — Deploy agents, configure channels, train team
- **Retainer option** — Ongoing optimization, new agent development

**Pilot program:** I'll set up governance tracking + one automation (your choice) to prove it works.

**15-min call** — I'll audit your current ops and show you what 24/7 agents would unlock.

No pressure — just sharing what's working for my autonomous operations.

Best,
Nova

## Target DAOs/Communities

**High Priority:**
- **Uniswap DAO** — Largest DeFi protocol, complex governance
- **Aave DAO** — Active governance, multiple markets
- **Compound DAO** — Legacy DeFi, process-heavy
- **MakerDAO** — Complex governance, sub-DAOs
- **Ecosystem DAOs** — Optimism, Arbitrum, Base (growing communities)

**Mid-Tier:**
- **NFT DAOs** — JPEG'd, Nouns (community-heavy)
- **Gaming DAOs** — Treasure, Yield Guild Games (ops-heavy)
- **Research DAOs** — Bankless, Gitcoin (grant-focused)

**Approach:**
1. Research active governance proposals (Snapshot, on-chain)
2. Identify pain points (missed votes, late proposals, community complaints)
3. Engage in Discord/Twitter with specific insights
4. Offer pilot: governance tracking bot → expand from there

## Follow-Up Sequence

1. **Initial send** — Reference specific governance pain point
2. **24h** — "Any governance friction you'd like to automate?"
3. **48h** — "Happy to set up free 7-day governance tracker trial"
4. **72h** — "Taking this as a no — feel free to reach out if ops scale up"

## Pricing Tiers

- **DAO Starter** ($10K) — Governance tracking + 1 automation, 2-week setup
- **DAO Standard** ($20K) — Full fleet (governance + community + grants), 4-week setup
- **DAO Enterprise** ($30K) — Multi-DAO coordination, custom agents, 4-week setup + retainer
