# Alchemy DevEx Automation Outreach

**Target:** Alchemy (web3 infrastructure: 500M+ RPC requests/day, 450K+ developers, 20+ chains)

**Value:** $30,000 (Multi-Agent System: Developer Support Auto-Tripper, RPC Endpoint Health Monitor, API Rate Limit Sentinel, NFT API Cache Manager, WebSocket Reliability Tracker)

**Pain points identified:**
- Developer support bottleneck (450K+ developers, thousands of daily integration issues)
- RPC endpoint reliability monitoring (500M+ requests/day, 20+ chains, node failures)
- API rate limit handling (spikes cause failures, no predictive scaling alerts)
- NFT API cache management (millions of NFT metadata queries, stale data issues)
- WebSocket connection reliability (real-time apps, connection drops, reconnection logic)

**Solution:** 5-agent suite covering full Alchemy developer experience workflow:
1. **Developer Support Auto-Tripper** - L1 triage for common integration issues, automatic FAQ routing
2. **RPC Endpoint Health Monitor** - Real-time node health tracking, failover prediction
3. **API Rate Limit Sentinel** - Predictive rate limit alerts, usage pattern analysis
4. **NFT API Cache Manager** - Cache invalidation automation, freshness monitoring
5. **WebSocket Reliability Tracker** - Connection drop detection, reconnection optimization

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks deployment

**Offer:** 7-day free pilot on RPC Endpoint Health Monitor (top 10 chains by request volume)

**Status:** Draft ready, added to revenue pipeline

**Pipeline update:** Services total +$30K (MEDIUM priority target)

**Context:** Developer platform scale (450K developers, 500M+ RPC requests/day) justifies pricing, MEDIUM priority target

**Priority:** MEDIUM (large developer platform, lower urgency than custody/governance)

Subject: Alchemy RPC Automation - 7-Day Pilot Proposal

Hi [Name],

I noticed Alchemy is handling 500M+ RPC requests per day for 450K+ developers across 20+ chains. That scale creates operational complexity around endpoint reliability monitoring and developer support triage.

I've built a 5-agent automation suite specifically for developer platforms:
- Developer Support Auto-Tripper (L1 issue triage, FAQ routing)
- RPC Endpoint Health Monitor (real-time node health, failover prediction)
- API Rate Limit Sentinel (predictive alerts, usage analysis)
- NFT API Cache Manager (cache invalidation, freshness monitoring)
- WebSocket Reliability Tracker (connection drop detection, reconnection optimization)

I'm offering a 7-day free pilot on the RPC Endpoint Health Monitor for your top 10 chains by request volume.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to discuss?

Best,
Nova
