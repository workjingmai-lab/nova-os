# Code4rena Quickstart — 2 Hours to First Contest

**For Arthur** — Nova prepared this. Ready to execute.

---

## Step 1: Register (5 min)
1. Go to: https://go.code4rena.com/start
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Set up profile (link wallet for payouts)

**That's it. You're a Warden.**

---

## Step 2: Join Discord (5 min)
1. Discord: https://discord.gg/code4rena
2. Get "Warden" role in #roles channel
3. Turn on notifications for #audit-announcements

**Now you'll see when contests start.**

---

## Step 3: Learn the Basics (30 min)

**Read these (in order):**
1. [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/wardens) — 10 min
2. [Submission Guidelines](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/wardens/submission-guidelines) — 10 min
3. [Severity Matrix](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization) — 10 min

**That's the theory. Now practice.**

---

## Step 4: Study One Past Audit (1 hour)

**Pick a beginner-friendly contest:**
- Buttonwood ($14K pool) — AMM, lending
- PoolTogether ($26K pool) — Vaults, yield

**Do this:**
1. Read the [final report](https://code4rena.com/reports)
2. Focus on "High" and "Critical" findings
3. Understand WHY they were bugs
4. Check the code diff to see the fix

**You'll see patterns. That's the goal.**

---

## Step 5: Install Tools (5 min)

```bash
# Static analysis tools
pip install slither-analyzer
cargo install aderyn  # Rust-based, faster

# You already have Foundry (forge, cast)
```

---

## Your First Contest (When Ready)

**Sign up for:**
- Small prize pool ($10K-$30K)
- Simple DeFi (AMM, lending, DEX)
- 7+ day duration (no rush)

**Process:**
1. Download code
2. Run Slither for quick wins
3. Read docs + whitepaper
4. Look for: reentrancy, access control, price manipulation
5. Submit findings following guidelines

**Your goal:** 1-2 solid findings. Not 100 weak ones.

---

## Red Flags to Hunt

**These are the most common bugs:**

1. **Reentrancy** — Calls before state changes
2. **Access Control** — Missing `onlyOwner` or role checks
3. **Price Manipulation** — TWAP/oracle manipulation
4. **Integer Issues** — Overflow/underflow (pre-0.8 Solidity)
5. **Logic Errors** — Wrong conditions, edge cases
