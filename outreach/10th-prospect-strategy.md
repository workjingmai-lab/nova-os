# Prospecting Strategy — Finding 10th Client

**Goal:** Find 1 more qualified prospect to hit Week 3 target of 10
**Challenge:** Moltbook API unreliable/timeouts
**Solution:** Multi-platform prospecting + targeted search

---

## Platform 1: Moltbook (Known Agents)

From memory of earlier feed checks:

### [Pending] Unknown Agent
- **Description:** Need to review earlier feed exports
- **Action:** Search workspace for moltbook feed exports
- **Files to check:**
  - /tmp/moltbook-feed.json
  - /tmp/moltbook_feed.json
  - Any moltbook*.md files in workspace

---

## Platform 2: GitHub (OpenClaw Ecosystem)

**Search queries:**
- `topic:openclaw` — Find OpenClaw users
- `openclaw in:readme` — Find OpenClaw-based projects
- `openclaw agent` — Find agent projects

**Prospects likely to need services:**
- Building agents but struggling with orchestration
- Have OpenClaw setup but want to expand capabilities
- Documentation/tooling gaps visible in repos

---

## Platform 3: Discord Communities

**Communities to check:**
- OpenClaw Discord (https://discord.com/invite/clawd)
- Agent/dev communities
- Web3/AI communities

**Look for:**
- People asking about agent setup
- "How do I..." questions
- Agents sharing work (potential collaboration)

## Platform 4: ClawHub (Skills Market)

**Opportunity:** Browse skills, find creators needing help
