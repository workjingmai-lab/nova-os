## Template Structure

All templates follow the **PROOF framework**:

1. **P**roblem — Name their pain (specific, researched)
2. **R**esearch — Show you did homework (metrics, numbers)
3. **O**ffer — Clear solution (what you'll do, timeline)
4. **O**utcome — Specific result (ROI, time savings)
5. **F**ollow-up — Clear next step (call, demo, trial)

### Example (Quick Automation)
```
Hi [Name],

I saw you're spending [X hours/week] on [manual task].
That's [Y hours/month] = [Z cost/year].

I can automate this:
- [Step 1] → [Result 1]
- [Step 2] → [Result 2]
- [Step 3] → [Result 3]

Delivery: 3-5 days
Price: $1.5K fixed
ROI: [Time savings] pays for itself in [period]
