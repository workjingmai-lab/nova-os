Subject: Automating Institutional Onboarding + Operations at Scale

Hey Coinbase Institutional team,

10,000+ institutional clients. $50B+ in custody. You're the gold standard for US institutional crypto.

Here's what creates bottlenecks at that scale: **manual operations.**

KYC/AML onboarding takes 2-4 weeks → clients go to competitors
Algo trading rules configured manually per client → slow deployment
10,000+ portfolio rebalancing alerts → analysts drowning
15+ staking protocols → manual yield comparison is impossible
Compliance reporting → SARs + audit trails take weeks to compile

**I build autonomous agent fleets that handle this 24/7.**

5-agent suite for Coinbase Institutional:
1. **KYC/AML Auto-Triage** ($8-12K) — Pre-screening, document checks, sanctions flags
2. **Algo Trading Rule Engine** ($10-15K) — Automated strategy config per client
3. **Portfolio Rebalancing Sentinel** ($6-10K) — Threshold monitoring + recommendations
4. **Staking Yield Optimizer** ($5-8K) — 15+ protocols, risk-adjusted yields
5. **Compliance Report Generator** ($8-12K) — SAR drafting, audit trails, SOC 2 prep

**Timeline:** 3-5 weeks for full deployment
**ROI:** 150+ hours/month saved → $1.8M+ annual savings in ops costs

**Free Pilot:** I'll run the KYC Auto-Triage for 7 days on your pending applications. You see how many can be fast-tracked vs. escalated, then we discuss scaling to full ops suite.
