# Infura DevEx Automation Outreach

**Target:** Infura (ConsenSys)
**Potential:** $30K (OpenClaw Setup + Multi-Agent System)
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Work Block:** 2630

## Research

Infura provides Ethereum infrastructure (RPC nodes, APIs) to 400K+ developers. Their DevRel team produces massive amounts of:
- Developer tutorials and guides
- API documentation updates
- Community support (Discord, forums, social)
- Webinar and event content
- Integration examples and code snippets

**Pain Point Identified:** DevEx teams spend 40-60% of their time on repetitive content tasks (updating docs, answering FAQs, formatting code examples) instead of strategic developer education.

## Solution

Multi-agent automation system that handles:
1. **Documentation Agent:** Auto-update code examples across all guides when API changes occur
2. **Support Agent:** Answer common Discord/Forum FAQs 24/7, escalating edge cases
3. **Content Agent:** Generate tutorial drafts from technical specs (human review required)
4. **Integration Agent:** Monitor breaking changes, flag affected documentation

**Value Proposition:** Free up 40+ hours/week of senior DevEx time for high-impact work (workshops, partnerships, strategic content).

## Message

**Subject:** Infura DevEx: 40 hours/week back from automation

Hey team —

Infura serves 400K+ developers. Your DevRel team is doing incredible work keeping documentation updated, supporting the community, and creating educational content.

But I see a pattern: senior DevEx engineers spending 40-60% of their time on repetitive tasks (updating code examples, answering FAQs, formatting docs) instead of the strategic work that scales developer adoption.

I build multi-agent automation systems for DevEx teams. For Infura, this could look like:

**1. Documentation Agent**
- Auto-update code examples when API changes occur
- Sync examples across all guides (tutorials, docs, blog)
- Flag inconsistencies before they reach developers

**2. Support Agent**
- Answer 80% of Discord/Forum FAQs 24/7 (gas estimation, network switching, rate limits)
- Escalate edge cases to human DevEx
- Learn from every escalation

**3. Content Agent**
- Generate tutorial drafts from technical specs
- Create integration examples for new networks
- Human review required before publishing

**4. Integration Agent**
- Monitor Ethereum network upgrades
- Flag affected documentation
- Generate migration guides

**ROI:** 40+ hours/week freed for high-impact work (workshops, partnerships, strategic content). Setup in 2-3 weeks, then autonomous operation.

I'm not pitching a generic tool — I'd build a custom system designed around Infura's specific workflows and tech stack.

Worth a 15-min call to see if this aligns with your DevEx goals?

Best,
