# Response Handling Guide

**Purpose:** Convert inbound replies to signed pilots
**Pipeline:** 39 messages → Target 20% response rate → 8 interested → Target 50% conversion = 4 pilots
**Goal:** Minimize response time, maximize conversion

**Action:** IMMEDIATE (within 1 hour)
1. Send pilot plan template (customized)
2. Schedule 15-min call to discuss
3. Prepare agreement

**Response Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

```
Hi [Name],

Totally understand — [current project] sounds like a big priority.

**Quick question:** When should I circle back? [Q2 April/May?] Or is there a better timeframe?

**In the meantime:**
I'll add you to my monthly newsletter where I share:
- Case studies from similar orgs
- New agent capabilities
- Industry insights

No spam, just signal. [Unsubscribe anytime if not useful.]

Best of luck with [project]!

Best,
Nova
```

**Key elements:**
- Respect their autonomy (don't push)

### 3. Wrong Person ("Talk to Sarah")
**Signals:**
- "I'm not the right contact"
- "You should reach out to [name]"
- "[Department] handles this"

**Action:** REDIRECT (warm intro)
1. Thank for referral
2. Ask for intro + context
3. Research new contact
4. Reference referrer in outreach

**Response Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for pointing me to [Sarah]!

**Would you be willing to make a warm intro?** Even a quick email cc'ing us both would be super helpful.

Context I'd love you to share:
- We discussed [topic]
- [Sarah] might be interested because [reason]
- I'm building [suite] for [outcome]

**If you can't introduce:**
Totally get it. Should I just reach out directly and mention you referred me?

Thanks for the help either way!

Best,
Nova
```

**Key elements:**
- Ask for warm intro (higher conversion)
- Provide context (makes it easy)
- Backup plan (cold outreach with referral)
- Gratitude (they're helping you)

**New outreach to Sarah:**
```
Hi [Sarah],

[Name] suggested I reach out to you about [topic].

We discussed [context] and [name] thought you'd be interested given [your role/background].

[Brief pitch + pilot plan attachment]

Should I send over a detailed proposal?

Best,
Nova

P.S. [Name] said great things about your work on [project]!
```

### 4. Negative ("Not interested")
**Signals:**
- "Not interested right now"
- "This doesn't fit our needs"
- "We're going in a different direction"
- No response after 5 touches

**Action:** LEARN + CLOSE
1. Ask why (data for improvement)
2. Accept gracefully (no chasing)
3. Close thread professionally
4. Add to "do not contact" list

**Response Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for getting back to me.

**Quick question:** What was the primary reason this wasn't a fit?
- Timing
- Budget
- Not a priority
- Wrong solution
- Other

I ask because I'm constantly improving my outreach and this feedback would be super helpful.

**No need to reply if you don't want to** — I'll close this thread either way.

Best of luck with [current initiative]!

Best,
Nova
```

**Key elements:**
- Optional feedback (don't demand)
- Accept gracefully (no hurt feelings)
- Close cleanly (professional)
- Learn from patterns (improve future outreach)

**If they respond with feedback:**
- Thank them
- Ask follow-up if unclear
- Document in CRM (look for patterns)
- DON'T try to overcome objection (it's over)

### 5. Questions/Objections
**Signals:**
- "How does this work?"
- "What's the tech stack?"
- "Is this secure?"
- "Who else are you working with?"

**Action:** EDUCATE + REASSURE
1. Answer directly (no fluff)
2. Provide proof (case studies, demos)
3. Address concerns transparently
4. Move to next step

**Response Template (for security questions):**
```
Hi [Name],

Great question! Security is critical for [org type] too.

**How we handle security:**
- Data access: [Specifics, e.g., "Read-only API access, no credentials stored"]
- Data storage: [Specifics, e.g., "Data processed in memory, never logged"]
- Compliance: [Specifics, e.g., "SOC2 compliant infrastructure"]

**Proof:**
- [Case study]: Similar deployment for [similar org]
- [Demo]: Can show you exactly what data flows where

**Still unsure:**
Happy to do a 15-min security walkthrough. [Calendar link]

Would that be helpful?

Best,
Nova
```

**Key elements:**
- Direct answer (no evasiveness)
- Specifics (build trust)
- Proof (reduce perceived risk)
- Low-friction next step

## Response Time Targets

| Priority | Response Time | Reason |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **Positive ("Yes")** | < 1 hour | Strike while hot |
| **Questions** | < 4 hours | Show competence |
| **Wrong person** | < 24 hours | Momentum transfer |
| **Busy/Timing** | < 48 hours | Respect + schedule |
| **Negative** | < 72 hours | Close gracefully |

**Why speed matters:**
- Leads talk to multiple vendors
- First to respond often wins
- Speed signals competence

## Follow-Up Sequences

### After Sending Pilot Plan
**Day 1:** "Any questions on the plan?"
**Day 3:** "Would a demo help with your decision?"
**Day 7:** "Gentle bump — timing still work for [timeline]?"
**Day 14:** Final bump or close

### After Call
**Within 1 hour:** Send recap + next steps
**Week 1:** Check-in on questions
**Week 2:** Move to agreement or close

### After Agreement Sent
**Day 1:** "Everything look good? Any redlines?"
**Day 3:** "Any questions on the terms?"
**Day 7:** "Still planning to move forward?"

## Red Flags 🚩

**Walk away if:**
- They won't provide data access needed
- They want custom work beyond pilot scope
- They ask for discounts (signals low perceived value)
- They're rude or disrespectful
- They want to own the IP (you're a service, not a dev shop)

**Polite decline template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for the conversation.

Based on what you've described, I don't think this is the right fit. I want to be upfront about that rather than waste your time.

[Reason, optional: "The scope you're describing is beyond what I can deliver effectively in 60 days."]

I hope you find the right partner!

Best,
Nova
```

## Tools & Workflow

**Tools:**
- follow-up-tracker.py (log responses, schedule follow-ups)
- Pilot plan template (customize in 15 min)
- Calendar link (instant scheduling)
- Agreement template (ready to sign)

**Workflow:**
1. Response arrives → Check category (Positive/Busy/Wrong/Negative/Question)
2. Select template → Customize in 5 min
3. Send → Update tracker
4. Calendar next action → Execute

**Metrics to track:**
- Response rate (messages delivered / replies)
- Response time (avg hours to respond)
- Conversion rate (replies / pilots started)
- Objection patterns (what stops deals)

---

## Competitor Positioning

**If they ask: "Who else are you working with?"**

**Good answer:**
```
I'm working with [similar orgs] on similar challenges:

- [Org 1]: [Challenge] → [Result]
- [Org 2]: [Challenge] → [Result]

Your situation is different (you're focused on [their focus]), but the same tech stack applies.

Would you like to see those case studies?
```

**Key elements:**
- Specific names (social proof)
- Specific results (numbers)
- Differentiation (you're not cookie-cutter)
- Optional depth (case studies)

**If they ask: "How are you different from [competitor]?"**

**Good answer:**
```
Great question!

**Key differences:**
- [Competitor] focuses on [their focus], I specialize in [your focus, e.g., "multi-agent ecosystems"]
- My approach: [your differentiation, e.g., "60-day pilots prove value before long-term commitment"]
- Tech stack: [your advantage, e.g., "OpenClaw's autonomous execution vs. rule-based automation"]

**[Competitor] is great for:** [compliment their strength]
**I'm better for:** [your strength, e.g., "Complex, multi-system workflows that require judgment"]

What's your top priority — [their likely priority]?
```

**Key elements:**
- Complement competitor (gracious)
- Differentiate clearly (not "we're better")
- Focus on strengths (not their weaknesses)
- Ask clarifying question (understand their needs)

---

## Final Notes

**Response principles:**
- Speed > Perfection (reply fast, iterate if needed)
- Specific > Generic (customized templates, not copy-paste)
- Help > Sell (solve their problem, don't push for close)
- Respect > Persistence (know when to walk away)

**The goal:** Not every lead converts. The right leads convert. Focus on qualified, interested prospects. Walk away from bad fits.
