# Day 14: Breakup Template

**Purpose:** Close the loop gracefully, trigger loss aversion  
**Send:** 14 days after initial message  
**Response rate:** 15-25% (highest in sequence!)**

## Template

```
Hey [Name],

Following up on [proposal/project].

Haven't heard back, so I assume [project] isn't a priority right now.

Totally understand — timing is everything.

I'll close this loop for now, but reach out anytime if [problem] resurfaces.

Best,
[Name]
```

## Why Breakup Emails Work

### 1. Loss Aversion
People hate losing opportunities more than they like gaining them.
- "Don't want to lose this" triggers action
- "Now or never" forces decision

### 2. Pressure Removal
- No more follow-ups coming
- Safe to ignore without guilt
- Paradoxically makes them respond

### 3. Scarcity
- "Won't bother you again" = limited time
- "Closing the loop" = finality
- Triggers "might regret not responding"

## Customization Guide

**Fill in:**
- `[Name]` — Their first name
- `[proposal/project]` — Reference initial outreach
- `[problem]` — Pain point from initial message

## DAO Examples

### Standard Breakup
```
Hey [Name],

Following up on the governance automation proposal.

Haven't heard back, so I assume this isn't a priority for Lido right now.

Totally understand — governance ops funding is tight, timing is everything.

I'll close this loop for now, but reach out anytime if coordination overhead resurfaces as a problem.

Best,
[Name]
```

### Problem-Specific Breakup
```
Hey [Name],

Following up on the delegate tracking tool.

Since I haven't heard back, I'm assuming the 10+ hour/week manual tracking isn't painful enough to automate yet.

Fair enough — if it's not broken, don't fix it.

I'll close the loop here, but ping me if that workload increases and you need relief.

Best,
[Name]
```

### Timing-Specific Breakup
```
Hey [Name],

Checking in on the governance agent pilot.

Assuming Q1 is already booked for your team and this got pushed down the priority list.

No worries at all — I know how DAO cycles go.

If things free up in Q2 and you want to revisit, let me know. Otherwise I'll move on.

Best,
[Name]
```

## Service Examples

### Budget-Focused Breakup
```
Hey [Name],

Following up on the automation proposal.

Assuming budget timing isn't right for this quarter.

Totally get it — automation is "nice to have" until it's "must have."

I'll close the loop here, but reach out when the manual workload becomes painful enough to justify the spend.

Best,
[Name]
```

### Priority-Focused Breakup
```
Hey [Name],

Checking in on the smart contract audit services.

Since I haven't heard back, I'm assuming security audits got deprioritized behind feature work.

Understandable — hard to justify audit spend when things haven't broken yet.

If that changes (or if you need a rush audit), I'm here.

Otherwise, I'll close the loop.

Best,
[Name]
```

### "Not A Fit" Breakup
```
Hey [Name],

Thinking about this more, I wonder if we're not actually the right fit for what you need.

[Specific reason: e.g., "you need a full-time dev," "you need enterprise SLA," "you need a different tech stack"].

Totally okay — better to know now than waste time on misaligned expectations.

If I'm wrong and this IS worth pursuing, let me know.

Otherwise, I'll wish you the best and close the loop.

Best,
[Name]
```

## Key Principles

1. **Assume, don't accuse** — "I assume" vs "You didn't respond"
2. **Validate their priorities** — "Timing is everything," "I get it"
3. **Remove guilt** — "Totally understand," "No worries"
4. **Leave door open** — "Reach out if [problem] resurfaces"
5. **Be genuine** — Not a fake "taking my ball and going home"

## What NOT to Do

❌ "Since you're not interested..." (passive-aggressive)
❌ "I guess you don't care about [problem]" (guilt trip)
❌ "Final notice!" (fake urgency)  
❌ "I'm deleting you from my list" (immature)
❌ "Your loss" (insulting)

**Why:** These signal bitterness, not confidence.

## The Psychology: Why This Gets Responses

**Before breakup:**
- Lead thinks: "I can respond later"
- Lead feels: "Low pressure, no urgency"
- Lead does: "Nothing"

**After breakup:**
- Lead thinks: "Wait, this might actually be valuable"
- Lead feels: "Don't want to miss this opportunity"
- Lead does: "Responds to keep door open"

**Key insight:** Scarcity + low pressure = response.

## Response Handling

### If They Respond: "Actually, I am interested"

**Best response:**
```
Hey [Name],

Glad to hear! I wasn't sure if this was still a priority.

[Next step: call, pilot, proposal].

When works for you?

Best,
[Name]
```

**Don't:**
- Act desperate ("I KNEW you'd come back!")
- Shame them ("I told you it was good")
- Rush them ("WE MUST ACT NOW")

### If They Respond: "Not right now, but maybe later"

**Best response:**
```
Hey [Name],

Appreciate the response — totally understand.

I'll add you to my quarterly check-in list and reach out in [month] if that works.

If [problem] becomes urgent before then, ping me.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Do:** Add to long-term nurture sequence
**Don't:** Keep following up weekly (that's annoying)

### If They Respond: "Not interested"

**Best response:**
```
Hey [Name],

Thanks for the response — appreciate the honesty.

Mind if I ask what would make this a yes?

[Curiosity, not defensiveness]

Best,
[Name]
```

**If they give feedback:** Note in tracker, improve future outreach
**If they don't respond:** Mark as LOST, move on

### If No Response

**Action:**
- Mark as LOST in tracker with reason "no response after 5 touches"
- Do NOT follow up again
- Move to next lead

**Why:** 5 touches is the limit. More = harassment.

## The "Salvage" Option

For high-value leads ($25K+), one last-ditch effort:

```
Hey [Name],

One last thought:

If [problem] is a priority but [budget/timing/boss] is the blocker, I'm happy to help you build internal support.

Case study, ROI calc, pilot proposal — whatever you need to get buy-in.

No obligation, just trying to be helpful.

If that's useful, let me know. Otherwise, I'll wish you the best.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Use sparingly:** Only for $25K+ opportunities where you genuinely want to help.

---

**Expected response rate:** 15-25% (highest in sequence!)  
**Time to customize:** 2 min  
**ROI:** Often converts "dead" leads into conversations — don't skip this
