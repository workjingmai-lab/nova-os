# Day 10: New Angle Template

**Purpose:** Approach problem from different perspective  
**Send:** 10 days after initial message  
**Response rate:** 8%

## Template

```
Hey [Name],

Been thinking about [problem] from a different angle.

[New perspective on problem — not the one we discussed before].

[One sentence on new solution/approach].

Might be worth exploring if [original approach] doesn't fit.

Best,
[Name]
```

## Customization Guide

**Fill in:**
- `[Name]` — Their first name
- `[problem]` — Reference initial outreach topic
- `[New perspective]` — Different angle on same pain
- `[One sentence on new solution]` — Brief alternative
- `[original approach]` — Reference what you proposed before

## Angle Types

### 1. Cost-Focused (if original was time-focused)
```
Original: "Save 10 hours/week"
New angle: "Cut $50K annual ops cost"
```

### 2. Risk-Focused (if original was efficiency-focused)
```
Original: "Move faster with automation"
New angle: "Reduce governance risk with better tracking"
```

### 3. Simplification-Focused (if original was feature-heavy)
```
Original: "Full-featured agent system"
New angle: "Start with one tool, expand later"
```

### 4. Proof-Focused (if original was concept)
```
Original: "Here's what we could build"
New angle: "Here's a working demo/pilot"
```

## DAO Examples

### Angle Switch: Efficiency → Risk
```
Original (Day 0): "Automate governance tracking to save 10 hrs/week"
New angle (Day 10): "Reduce governance risk by catching proposal conflicts early"

Hey [Name],

Been thinking about governance ops from a different angle.

Most DAOs focus on efficiency (faster votes, less overhead). 

But the bigger risk is proposal conflicts — two proposals passing that contradict each other.

We built a conflict detector that scans language before proposals go live. Caught 3 potential clashes last week alone.

Might be worth exploring if risk reduction is a bigger priority than time savings right now.

[Name]

### Angle Switch: Tool → Team
```
Original (Day 0): "Use our governance automation tools"
New angle (Day 10): "Augment your governance team with AI agents"

Hey [Name],

Different thought on the governance automation problem.

Instead of "buying tools," what if you added a 24/7 AI agent to your gov ops team?

No onboarding, no training, works while you sleep.

We've been piloting this with [similar DAO] — their human team focuses on strategy, the agent handles tracking/summarizing.

Totally different model than tool adoption.

Curious if that approach fits your team structure better?

## Service Examples

### Angle Switch: Build → Train
```
Original (Day 0): "We'll build a custom automation for you"
New angle (Day 10): "We'll train your team to build it themselves"

Hey [Name],

Different angle on the automation challenge.

Instead of us building it, what if we ran a 2-week workshop to train your team?

They'd learn to build simple automations, maintain them, expand them.

You'd own the IP, we'd teach the skills.

Long-term better, but more upfront work.

Might be a better fit if you prefer in-house capability.

Best,
[Name]
```

### Angle Switch: Full Project → Pilot
```
Original (Day 0): "$25K for full multi-agent system"
New angle (Day 10): "$3K for 30-day pilot to validate"

Hey [Name],

Thinking about the proposal from a different angle.

Instead of committing to the full system, what if we ran a 30-day pilot?

You'd get one agent, one use case, real results, $3K.

If it works, we scale. If not, you're out $3K vs $25K.

Lower risk, slower path to full value.

Might fit your budget/timing better than the all-in approach.

Best,
[Name]
```

## Key Principles

1. **Different angle, same problem** — Don't introduce new pain
2. **Acknowledge previous approach** — "Instead of X, what about Y?"
3. **Make it easier to say yes** — Lower commitment, lower risk
4. **Show flexibility** — Not dogmatic about one solution
5. **Be honest** — "This might not fit, but worth considering"

## What NOT to Do

❌ "Here's ANOTHER reason you should buy" (desperation)
❌ "I'm following up again" (guilt trip)  
❌ "Last time to respond" (fake urgency)
❌ Repeat same message with minor tweaks (noise)

**Why:** These signal you're not listening, just pushing.

## Response Handling

**If they respond with interest:**
- Acknowledge the pivot: "Glad this angle resonates"
- Propose specific next step
- Move to "conversation" stage

**If they respond with "still not interested":**
- Ask for feedback: "What would make this a yes?"
- If helpful → thank them, note in tracker
- If unresponsive → proceed to Day 14 breakup

**If no response:**
- Proceed to Day 14 breakup email (final touch)
- This is your last chance to re-engage

## Advanced: The "Not For You" Frame

Sometimes the most effective new angle is admitting it might not be a fit:

```
Hey [Name],

Thinking about this more, I wonder if our solution isn't actually a fit for you right now.

[Reason it might not fit: timing, budget, priorities].

Totally okay if that's the case — better to know now than waste time.

But if I'm wrong and this IS worth exploring, let me know.

Otherwise, I'll close the loop on my end.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Why works:** Removes pressure, triggers "don't want to lose this" response.

**Expected response rate:** 5-10%  
**Time to customize:** 3-5 min  
**ROI:** Re-frames problem for leads who didn't connect with first angle
