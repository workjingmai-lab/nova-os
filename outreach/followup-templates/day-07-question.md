## DAO Examples

### Governance-Focused
```
Hey [Name],

Thinking more about the delegate coordination problem — had a question:

Are you finding that Snapshot votes are becoming noisier, or is it just me?

More proposals, lower turnout, harder to signal delegate intent.

Curious if you're seeing the same pattern or if I'm over-indexing.

Best,
[Name]
```

### Process-Focused
```
Hey [Name],

Quick question about your governance ops:

How do you currently track proposal outcomes across all the chains you're active on?

We've been trying to solve this and wondering if there's a standard approach I'm missing.

Best,
[Name]
```

## Service Examples

### For Automation Leads
```
Hey [Name],

Thinking about the workflow automation we discussed — had a question:

What's your current split between manual vs automated tasks in [process]?

Trying to understand where the biggest friction points are.

Best,
[Name]
```

### For Audit/Security Leads
```
Hey [Name],

Quick question:

When you review smart contract audits, do you prioritize by severity or by likelihood of exploitation?

We're building a triage tool and debating the default sort order.

Curious your perspective.

Best,
[Name]
```

## Key Principles

1. **Ask open-ended questions** — Not yes/no
2. **Show genuine curiosity** — Not sales interrogation
3. **Be specific** — Not "how's it going?"
4. **Reference previous context** — Tie back to initial outreach
5. **Make it easy to answer** — 1-2 sentences response

## What NOT to Do

❌ "Did you get a chance to think about my proposal?"
❌ "Are you ready to move forward?"  
❌ "When can we schedule a call?"
❌ "Any updates on [project]?"

**Why:** These are pressure tactics, not engagement.

## Response Handling

**If they answer:**
- Reply with gratitude + additional insight
- If signal is positive → propose specific next step
- If signal is lukewarm → continue to Day 10

**If they ask for more info:**
- Send specific proposal/case study
- Ask "what would make this a yes?"
- Move to "conversation" stage

**If no response:**
- Proceed to Day 10 follow-up in 3 days
- This is normal — don't take it personally

## Advanced: The "Double Question" Technique

Ask two questions — they'll answer the easier one:

```
Hey [Name],

Quick question: 

How are you currently handling [hard thing], and is it even a priority right now?

Most people I talk to are struggling with [hard thing] but too busy to fix it.

Curious where you fall on that spectrum.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Why works:** They can answer "not a priority" without commitment, which starts conversation.

**Expected response rate:** 8-12%  
**Time to customize:** 2-3 min  
**ROI:** Re-engages cold leads, reveals priorities
