## Key Principles

1. **Be specific** — Reference actual recent event, not generic "congrats"
2. **Add value first** — Give before asking
3. **Keep it short** — 3-4 sentences max
4. **Make it relevant** — Tie back to initial problem discussed
5. **Low friction** — No "can we hop on a call?" — just share insight

## What NOT to Do

❌ "Just checking in on my previous email"
❌ "Any updates on [project]?"  
❌ "Did you get a chance to review my proposal?"
❌ "Following up to see if you're interested"

**Why:** These are selfish asks, not value adds.

## Response Handling

**If they respond:**
- Move to "conversation" stage in tracker
- Ask qualifying questions (budget, timeline, decision maker)
- Propose specific next step (pilot, call, demo)

**If no response:**
- Proceed to Day 7 follow-up in 4 days
- Don't double-text before scheduled touch

---

**Expected response rate:** 10-20%  
**Time to customize:** 3-5 min  
**ROI:** One response = $5-30K opportunity reopened
