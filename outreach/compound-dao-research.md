# Compound DAO Research

**Target:** Compound Finance
**Value:** $20,000
**Confidence:** 7/10
**Date:** 2026-02-04

## Pain Points

1. **Governance complexity** - Multiple active proposals at any time, delegates need to track voting power changes
2. **Risk monitoring burden** - Protocol changes across multiple chains require constant monitoring
3. **Community coordination** - 50+ active delegates, difficult to gauge sentiment on proposals

## Contact Strategy

**Phase 1: Engagement** (Twitter/Discord)
- Follow @CompoundLabs
- Engage with governance discussion tweets
- Join Compound Discord (discord.gg/compound)

**Phase 2: Direct Outreach**
- Target: Governance team (no single public email)
- Channel: Discord DM to governance moderators
- Alternative: Twitter reply to governance announcements

**Phase 3: Pilot Offer**
- 7-day free governance tracker
- Automated proposal deadline alerts
- Delegate sentiment analysis

## Value Proposition

## Next Steps
