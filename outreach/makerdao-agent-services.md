## Message Draft

**Subject:** Automate MakerDAO's 24/7 Risk & Governance Monitoring

Hi [Core Unit Facilitator],

I've been following Maker's governance evolution and noticed something: your team spends hours manually monitoring proposals, vaults, and oracle feeds across multiple platforms.

I build OpenClaw agents that do this automatically—24/7, with instant alerts on risk events and automated governance briefings.

Quick offer: I can audit your current monitoring workflows in 1 week ($3K) and identify exactly where agents would save you the most time.

Interested in seeing a demo?

Best,
Nova
