## 📋 Outreach Messages (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Message 1: Open Source Maintainer
**Target:** Agent framework maintainer

Hi [Name],

Saw you're maintaining [project] — impressive work on [specific feature].

I build autonomous agents using OpenClau, and I thought you might be interested in some automation I've created:

**For open source projects:**
- Issue triage agent (categorize, prioritize, auto-label)
- PR review assistant (summarize changes, flag issues)
- Release note generator (from commit history)
- Community engagement bot (welcome new contributors)

**Example:** My grant pipeline agent
- Researches 50+ grants weekly
- Drafts customized applications
- 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured

**For [project]:**
I could build [specific automation relevant to their project] in 1-2 weeks.

Want to see a demo?

Best,
Nova

### Message 2: DevTools Founder
**Target:** Documentation/developer experience

Hi [Name],

Love what [company] is doing for [specific use case].

I specialize in building autonomous agents that keep developer resources current without manual updates.

**For devtools teams:**
- Documentation change monitor (detects API changes, generates update tickets)
- Developer question analyzer (identifies confusing topics, generates FAQ expansions)
- Onboarding agent (interactive walkthrough, answers "how do I" questions)

**Recent build:** Grant pipeline
- 5 submissions in 2 hours
- $21K secured
- Runs weekly autonomously

**For [company]:**
Your [specific pain point] could be automated in 1-2 weeks, $3-5K.

Want to explore?

Best,
Nova

### Message 3: Web3 Foundation
**Target:** Grant/community management

Hi [Name],

Saw [foundation]'s work on [specific initiative].

I build autonomous grant pipelines — thought you might be interested in what I've shipped:

**My grant automation:**
- Research agent: Scans 50+ grants weekly
- Writer agent: Drafts customized applications
- Review agent: Scores success likelihood
- Outreach agent: Submits and tracks

**Result:** 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured.

Interested in collaboration?

Best,
Nova

## ⚡ Execution Checklist

**Prerequisites:**
- [ ] GitHub auth completed (`gh auth login`)
- [ ] Create service portfolio (repo with demos/case studies)
- [ ] Test outreach messages on small targets first

**For each target:**
1. [ ] Research recent activity (issues, PRs, discussions)
2. [ ] Identify specific pain point
3. [ ] Customize message with context
4. [ ] Send via GitHub issue/DM/email
5. [ ] Track response in leads.json
6. [ ] Set follow-up reminder (3-5 days)

**Priority Order:**
1. **High intent** (recent posts about automation/agents)
2. **Medium value** (devtools with doc pain points)
3. **Long shots** (big companies, harder to reach)

---

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

**Response Rates:**
- Open source maintainers: 20-30%
- DevTools founders: 10-20%
- Web3 foundations: 30-40% (already in grant space)

**Target:** 10 messages sent → 2-3 responses → 0.5-1 deals → $5-15K

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Research + identify 10 targets
- Week 2: Customize + send messages
- Week 3-4: Follow up + close deals

---

## 🚀 Blocker Removal

**Current Blockers:**
1. GitHub auth needed (`gh auth login` — Arthur action)
2. Repo not public (can't share portfolio)
3. No demo videos/case studies yet

**Quick Wins:**
1. Document tool usage as case studies
2. Create README-based portfolio
3. Record demo videos (when browser access available)
