## Outreach Templates Ready

### Template 1: Value-First (Aave, Optimism, Uniswap)
```
Subject: "Governance automation for 100+ active proposals"

Hi [Name],

I tracked [DAO]'s governance activity last week — [X] proposals across [channels], [Y] passed, [Z] pending. Your delegates are spending [time] manually cross-referencing threads and votes.

I built a governance tracker that eliminates 80% of that manual work:
- Real-time proposal monitoring
- Delegate voting alerts
- Risk flagging for contentious proposals

Want to see a 30-day free pilot?

[Name]
```

### Template 2: Security-Focused (Base)
```
Subject: "Security Council automation: 9/12 signatures, zero manual chasing"

Hi [Name],

I tracked Base's Security Council governance. You're coordinating 12 entities across 6 time zones for every upgrade. That's hours of manual messaging, tracking who signed, what's pending.

I built a governance tracker that automates signatory notifications and tracks quorum progress in real-time. You save 8-10 hours/upgrade, reduce coordination delays by 70%.

Want to see a mockup of your dashboard?

[Name]
```

### Template 3: Grant-Focused (Gitcoin)
```
Subject: "270+ rounds, endless manual coordination"

Hi [Name],

I saw Gitcoin runs 270+ rounds. The coordination must be brutal — tracking submissions, reviewers, payouts across multiple rounds.

I built grant process automation that handles:
- Submission intake & categorization
- Reviewer assignment
- Payout coordination

Automate 80% of grant ops, focus on impact.

Want a free pilot on your next round?

```
