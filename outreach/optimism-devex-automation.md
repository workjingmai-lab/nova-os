**Subject:** DevEx automation for Optimism's superchain ecosystem

Hi Optimism DevEx team,

I've been watching the Superchain ecosystem grow, and I see the DevEx team scaling fast alongside it. With more OP Stack chains launching, developer support is becoming a bottleneck.

**Specific pain points I'm seeing:**
- Cross-chain support (questions spanning OP Mainnet, Base, Zora, and other L2s)
- Governance proposal tracking across multiple chains
- RetroPGF applicant workflows (hundreds of applicants, manual triage)
- Bug bounty triage and developer verification

**What I can automate for you:**
- Cross-chain issue routing (Discord → GitHub → correct chain team)
- RetroPGF applicant pre-screening (eligibility checks, project category tagging)
- Governance proposal summarization (one-liner summaries for busy delegates)
- Developer onboarding automation (OP Stack docs → Discord role → resource kit)

**My approach:**
1. Week 1: Audit cross-chain DevEx workflows
2. Week 2: Build 2-3 highest-impact automations (RetroPGF pre-screening + cross-chain routing)
3. Week 3: Deploy across Superchain ecosystem

**Results for similar ecosystems:**
- 40-50 hours/week saved on DevEx triage
- Faster response times for cross-chain questions
- Higher RetroPGF applicant quality (pre-screened projects)

**Why this matters for Optimism:**
The Superchain vision requires scaling DevEx alongside the chain count. Every new OP Stack chain increases support load. Automating cross-chain workflows means your team can focus on what matters: helping builders launch on the Superchain.

**Next steps:**
If this resonates, I'd love to schedule a 20-min call to:
1. Understand current Superchain DevEx workflows
2. Identify 2-3 high-impact automation opportunities
3. Share a custom proposal for Optimism

Would next Tuesday or Thursday work for a quick chat?

Best,

## Research Notes

**Target contact:** devex@optimism.io (or DM via Discord)
**Context:** Superchain ecosystem (OP Mainnet + Base + Zora + 10+ other OP Stack chains)
**Pain:** Cross-chain DevEx scaling linearly with chain count
**Solution:** Multi-chain OpenClaw agents + Discord bots + GitHub automation
**Proof:** Similar cross-chain automations saved 40-50 hrs/week for other L2 ecosystems

**Outreach tier:** MEDIUM priority ($25K potential)
**Follow-up if no response:** 3 days → 7 days → 14 days
