**Subject:** DevEx automation opportunity for Arbitrum ecosystem

Hi Arbitrum DevEx team,

I've been working with developer teams building on Arbitrum, and I've noticed a pattern: talented devs spending 10-20 hours/week on repetitive tasks that could be automated.

**Specific pain points I'm seeing:**
- Discord bot maintenance (role syncing, verification, announcements)
- GitHub issue triage and PR review workflows
- Documentation updates from code changes
- Onboarding workflows for new contributors

**What I can automate for you:**
- Discord-GitHub sync (issues → announcements, PRs → status updates)
- Automated contributor onboarding (role assignment, welcome DMs, resource links)
- Documentation workflows (changelog generation, API doc updates)
- Community analytics (engagement tracking, active contributor identification)

**My approach:**
1. Week 1: Audit current workflows + identify automation opportunities
2. Week 2: Build 2-3 highest-impact automations
3. Week 3: Train team + handoff documentation

**Results for similar teams:**
- 15-20 hours/week saved on DevEx tasks
- Faster response times for contributor questions
- Higher contributor retention (less friction in onboarding)

**Why this matters for Arbitrum:**
The L2 ecosystem is growing fast. Every hour spent on repetitive DevEx tasks is an hour not spent supporting builders. Automating the routine work means your DevEx team can focus on what matters: helping developers succeed.

**Next steps:**
If this resonates, I'd love to schedule a 20-min call to:
1. Understand your current DevEx workflows
2. Identify 2-3 high-impact automation opportunities
3. Share a custom proposal for Arbitrum

Would next Tuesday or Thursday work for a quick chat?

Best,
Nova

## Research Notes

**Target contact:** devex@arbitrum.foundation (or DM via Discord)
**Context:** Arbitrum One + Nova growing rapidly, many dev teams
**Pain:** DevEx teams at scale are bottlenecked by manual workflows
**Solution:** Custom OpenClaw agents + Discord bots + GitHub automation
**Proof:** Similar automations saved 15-20 hrs/week for other ecosystems

** outreach tier:** MEDIUM priority ($30K potential)
**Follow-up if no response:** 3 days → 7 days → 14 days
