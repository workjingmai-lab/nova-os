# Service Proposal: Web3 Automation Integration

**Pricing:** $3-7K | **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks | **Category:** Smart Contract Automation

---

## What You Get

**Automated Web3 workflows** that interact with smart contracts, monitor blockchain events, and execute transactions without manual intervention.

### Core Deliverables

1. **Event Monitoring System**
   - Real-time smart contract event listeners (logs, state changes)
   - Filtered notification system (only what matters)
   - Historical event querying and analytics

2. **Transaction Automation**
   - Scripted transaction flows (batch operations, recurring actions)
   - Gas optimization strategies
   - Safety checks and simulation before execution

3. **Dashboard & Reporting**
   - Real-time monitoring dashboard ( balances, positions, pending actions)
   - Transaction history and success rates
   - Alert system for critical events

### Tech Stack

- **Smart Contract Interaction:** ethers.js / web3.py
- **Event Monitoring:** The Graph / node webhooks
- **Automation:** Python/Node.js scripts with scheduling
- **Dashboards:** Grafana / custom web UI

---

## Use Cases

**DeFi Operations:** Automate yield farming rebalancing, liquidity pool management, or staking/unstaking based on conditions.

**DAO Participation:** Auto-vote on proposals, delegate tokens, monitor governance activity.

**NFT Management:** Monitor floor prices, automate listings, track portfolio value.

**Token Operations:** Batch transfers, vesting schedule execution, airdrop management.

---

## Pricing Options

**Tier 1 ($3K):** Single-chain event monitoring + basic automation (e.g., auto-approve, simple swaps)

**Tier 2 ($5K):** Multi-chain support + advanced automation (conditional logic, batch operations)

**Tier 3 ($7K):** Full-stack solution + custom dashboard + ongoing support (2 weeks)

**Add-ons:**
- Ongoing monitoring and updates: $1K/month
- Additional chains: +$500 per chain
- Emergency response SLA: +$500 flat

---

## Why This Works

Web3 is 24/7. Humans aren't. Automation fills the gap:

- **Never miss an opportunity:** React to market conditions in seconds, not hours
- **Reduce errors:** Scripts don't fatigue or mistype addresses
- **Scale operations:** Execute 100 transactions as easily as 1
- **Sleep better:** Know your systems are working while you're not

## What I Need From You

1. **Goal:** What problem are we solving? (e.g., "Automate yield farming position rebalancing")
2. **Contracts:** Which smart contracts do we interact with? (addresses, ABIs if available)
3. **Conditions:** What triggers actions? (e.g., "If APY drops below X, move funds to Y")
4. **Budget:** Which tier fits your needs?
5. **Timeline:** Any urgent deadlines or specific launch dates?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Discovery Call (30 min):** Clarify requirements, assess technical feasibility
2. **Proposal & Quote:** Detailed scope with fixed pricing
3. **Development:** 1-2 weeks iterative build with demo checkpoints
4. **Testing:** Testnet validation + mainnet dry-runs
5. **Deployment:** Go live with handover documentation

---

## Example Projects

**Yield Farming Bot:** Monitors 3 lending protocols, auto-rebalances when APY shifts >10% ($5K)

**Vesting Schedule Executor:** Automatically releases tokens to team members per schedule ($3K)

**NFT Floor Price Alert:** Monitors 5 collections, sends alerts when floor drops threshold ($2K)

**DAO Auto-Voter:** Votes on proposals based on pre-defined alignment criteria ($4K)
