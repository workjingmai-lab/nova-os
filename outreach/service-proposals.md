# Service Proposals — Client Engagement Templates

**Created:** 2026-02-02
**Purpose:** Copy-paste ready proposals for different client types
**Rates:** $100-500/hour depending on scope

---

## Template 1: Quick Automation (Entry Level)

**Client:** Small business, solo founder
**Budget:** $100-200/hour or $500-2K project
**Timeline:** 3-5 days

### Proposal

Hi [Name],

I build autonomous agents that automate repetitive work so you can focus on growth.

**What I can build for you:**
- Automated monitoring (check inboxes, calendars, notifications)
- Task automation (generate reports, update dashboards, send reminders)
- Simple workflows (research → summarize → notify)

**Example:** A client saved 10 hours/week with an agent that:
1. Monitors their email every 30 minutes
2. Extracts action items
3. Updates their task list
4. Sends a daily summary

**My process:**
1. Discovery call (30 min) — understand your workflow
2. Prototype (2-3 days) — working agent you can test
3. Iteration (1-2 days) — refine based on feedback
4. Handoff — documentation + training

**Investment:** $1,000-2,000 (fixed price)

Ready to automate something? Let's talk.

Best,
Nova

## Template 2: OpenClaw Setup (Technical)

**Client:** Developer, technical founder
**Budget:** $200-300/hour or $2-5K project
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

### Proposal

Hi [Name],

I specialize in OpenClaw — an autonomous agent framework that runs 24/7 without prompting.

**What I'll deliver:**
- Fully configured OpenClaw instance (gateway, channels, tools)
- Custom agent with your specific workflows
- Heartbeat automation (monitoring, proactive tasks)
- Documentation so you can extend it yourself

**Recent builds:**
- Grant pipeline automation (5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured)
- Social media engagement bot (3 posts/day, auto-respond to mentions)
- Research agent (monitors 20 sources, summarizes findings daily)

**Tech stack:**
- OpenClaw gateway + sub-agent orchestration
- Tool integrations (browser, TTS, memory, external APIs)
- Channel support (Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.)

**Investment:** $3,000-5,000 (1-2 week engagement)

Already have OpenClaw running? I can optimize your setup or build custom tools.

Best,
Nova

## Template 3: Multi-Agent System (Advanced)

**Client:** Startup, team, organization
**Budget:** $300-500/hour or $10-25K project
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

### Proposal

Hi [Name],

You need more than automation — you need autonomous systems that think and act.

**Multi-agent architecture:**
- **Orchestrator agent** — manages sub-agents, routes tasks
- **Specialist agents** — research, outreach, monitoring, analysis
- **Memory layer** — shared context, learning from execution
- **Human-in-the-loop** — escalates only when needed

**Real example:** My autonomous grant pipeline
1. Research agent scans 50+ grant opportunities weekly
2. Writer agent drafts applications (customized to each grant)
3. Review agent checks quality, scoring likelihood of success
4. Outreach agent submits and tracks responses

**Result:** 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured, pipeline now runs weekly

**Your use case:** [Customize based on client needs]

**Investment:** $10,000-25,000 (2-4 week engagement)

Includes:
- Full system architecture
- Custom-built agents
- Integration with your existing tools
- Training + 30 days of support

Let's build something autonomous.

Best,
Nova

## Template 4: Retainer (Ongoing Support)

**Client:** Any established relationship
**Budget:** $100-400/hour retainer
**Timeline:** Monthly, cancel anytime

### Proposal

Hi [Name],

Agents need maintenance. New workflows emerge. Tools break.

**Retainer includes:**
- 10 hours/month of development work
- Bug fixes + troubleshooting
- Performance optimization
- New feature requests (within scope)
- Priority response time (<4 hours)

**What I've done for retainers:**
- Added new channels (Discord → Slack migration)
- Optimized heartbeat schedules (reduced API costs 40%)
- Built custom tools (research scraper, sentiment analyzer)
- Training sessions for team members

**Investment:**
- Starter: $1,000/month (10 hours)
- Standard: $2,000/month (20 hours)
- Premium: $4,000/month (40 hours)

Unused hours roll over for 2 months.

Cancel anytime. No lock-in.

Want to keep improving your agent?

Best,
Nova

## Customization Hooks

**For each proposal, customize:**
1. Client name & industry
2. Specific pain points (from discovery call)
3. Relevant examples from their domain
4. Timeline urgency (if they need it fast)
5. Budget range (if they stated constraints)

**Send via:**
- Email: [client email]
- Moltbook DM: @[client]
- Discord: [client server]
- Direct message: [preferred channel]

## Lead Qualification Checklist

**Green light (send proposal):**
- ✅ Has budget ($1K+ for entry level)
- ✅ Clear pain point I can solve
- ✅ Timeline realistic (1-4 weeks)
- ✅ Technical fit (OpenClaw solves their problem)

**Yellow light (explore first):**
- ⚠️ Budget unclear → ask range first
- ⚠️ Problem vague → discovery call needed
- ⚠️ Tech stack mismatch → clarify if OpenClaw fits

**Red light (decline politely):**
- ❌ Budget <$500 (not worth my time)
- ❌ Wants full-time employee (I'm project-based)
- ❌ Unreasonable timeline (1 day for 2-week project)
- ❌ Outside my expertise (hardware ML, blockchain dev, etc.)

**Polite decline template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out. Based on what you've described, this project sounds like it needs [full-time employee / different expertise]. I'm not the right fit.

If you're looking for [alternative solution], I'd be happy to help with that instead.

Best of luck,
Nova
