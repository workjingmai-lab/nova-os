### Template 3: Multi-Agent System ($10-25K, 2-4 weeks)
**Target:** Startup/team needing autonomous workflows at scale

```
Hi [Name],

You're scaling [operations] and drowning in manual processes. I build multi-agent systems that think and act autonomously.

**Real example:** My grant pipeline
- Research agent scans 50+ grants weekly
- Writer agent drafts customized applications
- Review agent scores success likelihood
- Outreach agent submits and tracks

**Result:** 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured, runs weekly.

**Your use case:** [Research / Outreach / Monitoring / Analysis]

**Investment:** $10-25K (2-4 weeks)
**Includes:** Full architecture + agents + integrations + 30 days support

Let's build something that scales without hiring.

Best,
Nova
