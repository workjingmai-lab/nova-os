## Executive Summary

You're spending hours on repetitive tasks that could be automated in days. I build custom automation solutions using OpenClaw that save you 5-10+ hours per week.

## Problem Statement

Based on our conversation, you're experiencing:
- [Task 1] — e.g., "Manual data entry from emails to spreadsheet"
- [Task 2] — e.g., "Daily report generation takes 2 hours"
- [Task 3] — e.g., "Customer notifications sent manually"

These tasks are:
- ❌ Time-consuming (X hours/week)
- ❌ Error-prone (manual entry mistakes)
- ❌ Scaling poorly (more work = more time)

## Proposed Solution

I'll build custom automations using OpenClaw that:
- ✅ Eliminate repetitive work (save X hours/week)
- ✅ Reduce errors to near-zero
- ✅ Scale automatically without extra effort

### Deliverables

1. **Automation 1:** [Description]
   - Input: [What data it needs]
   - Output: [What it produces]
   - Time saved: [X hours/week]

2. **Automation 2:** [Description]
   - Input: [What data it needs]
   - Output: [What it produces]
   - Time saved: [X hours/week]

3. **Handoff documentation:**
   - How to run each automation
   - How to modify/troubleshoot
   - Quick reference guide

## Timeline

- **Day 1:** Requirements finalization + environment setup
- **Day 2-3:** Build automations + testing
- **Day 4:** Integration testing + refinement
- **Day 5:** Deployment + handoff + training

## Investment

**Fixed price:** $1,500 - $2,000 USD

What you get:
- Custom-built automations (yours to keep)
- Full documentation + training
- 30-day support included
- Modifications if scope doesn't change

## ROI Calculation

- Current time spent: [X hours/week] × $[hourly rate] = $[cost/week]
- Automation saves: [X hours/week] × $[hourly rate] = $[savings/week]
- **Payback period:** ~[X] weeks
- **Annual savings:** ~$[X]

1. ✅ Confirm requirements (15-min call)
2. ✅ I send detailed specification
3. ✅ You approve + we start
4. ✅ Working automations in 3-5 days
