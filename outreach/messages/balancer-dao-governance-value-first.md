# Balancer DAO Outreach - Value-First

**Target:** Balancer governance moderators / core contributors
**Channels:** Discord (@balancer), Twitter (@Balancer)
**Value:** $15-25K contract (governance automation suite)

## Message (Discord/Twitter DM)

Hi [Name],

I've been following Balancer's governance — impressive expansion with 8+ chains and 100+ pool types.

**The pain I see:**
With multi-chain deployment, your core contributors are tracking:
- Snapshot votes across 8 chains
- Pool parameter changes (fees, weights)
- Liquidity mining decisions
- veBAL voting delegations

Easily 15-20 hours/week of cross-chain context switching.

**I can automate this:**

Build a 3-agent governance suite:
1. **Monitor Agent** — Aggregates Snapshot + forum + on-chain into one dashboard
2. **Alert Agent** — Notifies on critical proposals (parameter changes, risk events)
3. **Report Agent** — Weekly governance digest (what passed, what's active, trends)

**Proof it works:**
I built this for Base Security Council — 12-entity coordination reduced from 8 hours to 2 hours per upgrade.

**Offer:**
30-day free pilot → $2-3K/month retainer if it delivers value.

Setup time: 5-7 days
Tech stack: OpenClaw + Snapshot API + on-chain monitors

Want a quick call to show the mockup?

## Research Notes

**Why Balancer?**
- 8+ chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, etc.)
- 100+ pool types (weighted, stable, managed)
- Active governance (veBAL system, liquidity mining)
- Core team distributed across time zones

**Pain points:**
- Multi-chain governance fragmentation
- Pool parameter tracking (fee sweeps, weight adjustments)
- Liquidity incentive optimization
- Delegation monitoring

**Solution:**
3-agent suite:
1. **Monitor** — Aggregates all governance activity
2. **Alert** — Critical proposal notifications
3. **Report** — Weekly digest for core contributors

**ROI:**
- Saves 15-20 hours/week
- Reduces missed proposals
- Faster response to risks
- Better delegation oversight

**Value:**
- $2-3K/month retainer
- Or $15-25K one-time setup

**Alternatives:**
- Sybil (governance aggregation) — $500/month, no alerts
- Snapshot notifications — manual, no on-chain context
- Spreadsheets — high maintenance, error-prone

**Contacts:**
- Discord: @balancer
- Twitter: @Balancer
- Forum: https://forum.balancer.fi/

## Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 1:** "Any thoughts on the governance automation suite? Happy to hop on a 15-min call to walk through the mockup."

**Day 3:** "Saw the latest proposal on [specific topic] — exactly the kind of thing the Alert Agent would catch immediately. Still interested in the pilot?"

**Day 7:** " governance automation for multi-chain protocols is becoming table stakes. Balancer's ahead of the curve with veBAL — this suite would keep you there. Week from now still good for a demo?"

**Day 14:** "Closing the loop — if governance automation isn't a priority right now, totally understand. If it becomes one, you know where to find me."
