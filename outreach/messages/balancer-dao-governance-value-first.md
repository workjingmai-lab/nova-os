## Value-First Outreach Message

**Hey Balancer team,**

I've been following Balancer's governance — smart pool proposals are getting complex fast.

**Problem I see:**
Core contributors are drowning in proposal tracking across multiple pools (weighted, stable, boosted, managed). Each pool type has different parameters, risk factors, and voting cycles. Keeping track manually = missed opportunities + governance fatigue.

**What I built:**
3-agent suite specifically for Balancer's multi-pool governance:

1. **Smart Pool Tracker** — Monitors all pool types, highlights proposals affecting your configured pools
2. **Parameter Sentinel** — Alerts on fee/weight/amp factor changes before they hit vote
3. **Delegate Pulse** — Shows how top delegates are voting on similar pools (context for your decisions)

**Outcome:**
- 30% reduction in governance overhead (less tracking, more acting)
- Zero missed critical pool proposals
- Faster response time to parameter changes

**Pilot:**
30-day free trial. Deploy all 3 agents → track your pool stack → measure time saved.

If it works, we discuss a $20K setup + $2K/month retainer for maintenance.
If not, you got 30 days of free governance coverage.

**Why now:**
Balancer's v2 momentum + pool diversification = governance complexity is only increasing. Early adopters of automation get the edge.

**Next step:**
Want to see a 10-min demo of the Smart Pool Tracker on your current governance data?

Best,
Nova

## PROOF Framework Analysis

**P - Problem:**
"Core contributors drowning in proposal tracking across multiple pool types (weighted, stable, boosted, managed). Each pool has different parameters, risk factors, voting cycles. Manual tracking = missed opportunities + governance fatigue."

**R - Research:**
- Balancer V2 has 4+ pool types with different governance mechanics
- Smart pool customization requires monitoring parameter changes
- Multi-pool ops teams (5-20 people) feel tracking pain acutely
- Balancer's governance volume is up Q4 2025 (more proposals = more overhead)

**O - Offer:**
3-agent suite tailored to Balancer's structure:
1. **Smart Pool Tracker** - Pool-specific proposal monitoring (highlights proposals affecting configured pools)
2. **Parameter Sentinel** - Fee/weight/amp factor change alerts (pre-vote visibility)
3. **Delegate Pulse** - Top delegate voting patterns on similar pools (decision context)

**O - Outcome:**
- 30% reduction in governance overhead (less tracking, more acting)
- Zero missed critical pool proposals
- Faster response time to parameter changes (pre-vote alerts)
- ROI: 20 hours/week saved × $150/hr contributor time = $3K/week value

**F - Follow-up:**
- Day 0: Initial message sent
- Day 3: "Balancer's new boosted pools — would the Smart Pool Tracker help monitor these?"
- Day 7: "Pool volume up 27% this week — governance complexity tracking"
- Day 14: Last check-in: "Still interested in the 30-day pilot?"
- Day 21: Close loop (move to next tier or nurture)
