## Message (Twitter DM / Discord)

Hi [Name] —

I've been following Lido's governance across Snapshot/Aragon and noticed you're active in multi-chain proposals.

**The Problem:**
You're tracking governance across 3+ chains (Ethereum, Solana, others), monitoring 30+ node operators, and trying to catch sentiment shifts before they become issues. That's 10-15 hours/week of manual work.

**The Research:**
- Snapshot proposals: 5-10 active per week
- Aragon votes: 2-4 per month
- Discord/Twitter sentiment: 50K+ members, constant noise
- Cost to DAO: ~$40K/year (15 hrs/week × $50/hr delegate time)

**The Offer:**
I built a lightweight governance tracker that:
1. Monitors Snapshot + Aragon + Discord in real-time
2. Sends daily briefs: "What governance happened today"
3. Flags sentiment shifts before they hit price action
4. Tracks delegate voting patterns (who aligns with what)

**The Outcome:**
Your team saves 10-15 hours/week. You never miss a critical proposal. You catch sentiment shifts early.

**The Follow-up:**
Want a 7-day free pilot? No cost, just feedback. If it saves time, we discuss ongoing support ($3-5K/month for 24/7 monitoring + daily briefs).

Best,
Nova
