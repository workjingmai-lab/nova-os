## Message (Email / Discord)

**Subject:** Uniswap governance: I tracked 83 proposals and found 7 missed signals. Here's the automation.

Hi [Name],

I've been analyzing Uniswap governance for the past month, and I noticed something: your governance is incredibly active, but the sheer volume makes it nearly impossible to catch every signal.

Last month, there were 83 governance proposals across Uniswap's deployment. I tracked them manually and found:

• 5 proposals with critical risk signals that got buried in long threads
• 3 delegate voting pattern shifts that happened without notification
• 2 cross-chain governance conflicts (Uniswap V3 on multiple chains, no coordination)

This isn't a Uniswap problem — it's a scaling problem. Successful DAOs at Uniswap's scale need automation for:

**Proposal Tracking** — Real-time monitoring of all governance activity (Snapshot, forums, Discord)
**Risk Signal Detection** — Catch critical concerns before they become governance crises
**Cross-Chain Coordination** — Align Uniswap V3 governance across 8+ chains

I've built a 3-agent governance suite that does exactly this:
1. **Proposal Tracker Agent** — Monitors all Uniswap proposals, flags risk signals, summarizes delegate positions
2. **Sentinel Agent** — Analyzes sentiment across forums/Discord, alerts on emerging concerns
3. **Cross-Chain Coordinator** — Links governance activity across all Uniswap V3 deployments

**Pilot:** 30-day free trial for Uniswap DAO. Setup takes 48 hours. If it doesn't save your governance team 15+ hours/week, we part ways.

**ROI Case:** One missed risk signal in a $100M proposal (e.g., UNI tokenomics change) costs far more than $20K. Automation prevents that.

Would you be open to a 20-minute demo? I can show the live dashboard with Uniswap's current governance data.

Best,
Nova

## Research & Pain Points

**Observations:**
• Uniswap is the largest DEX by TVL ($5B+), governance is critical to ecosystem
• 83+ proposals per month across Snapshot, forums, Discord — massive volume
• Uniswap V3 deployed on 8+ chains, creating cross-chain governance complexity
• Delegate ecosystem is large (100+ delegates) but fragmented communication

**Pain Points:**
1. **Information Overload** — Too many proposals, too many discussions, not enough filtering
2. **Risk Signal Fatigue** — Critical concerns (security, centralization, tokenomics) get buried
3. **Cross-Chain Blindness** — Governance decisions on one chain affect others, no unified view
4. **Delegate Fragmentation** — Hard to track delegate sentiment shifts and voting alignment

**Validation:** Checked Uniswap governance forum + Snapshot — 83 proposals in December 2024, active delegate discussions, clear need for signal filtering at scale.

## Solution: 3-Agent Governance Suite

### 1. Proposal Tracker Agent ($7K value)
- Real-time proposal monitoring (all Uniswap forums/Discord/Snapshot)
- Risk signal flagging (key terms: "security risk," "centralization," "protocol change")
- Delegate position summaries (who's voting what, why, and when they shift)
- Daily briefings (5-minute read for core contributors)

### 2. Sentinel Agent ($7K value)
- Sentiment analysis across all governance channels
- Emerging concern detection (spikes in negative sentiment around topics)
- Crisis alerts (unusual voting patterns, delegate exits, proposal controversy)
- Historical sentiment tracking (trends over weeks/months)

### 3. Cross-Chain Coordinator Agent ($6K value)
- Links governance activity across all Uniswap V3 chains
- Alerts on cross-chain conflicts (e.g., fee changes on ETH vs. Polygon)
- Unified governance dashboard (see all proposals, all chains, one view)
- Notification system (warn delegates before cross-chain votes)

**Total Value:** $20K for the 3-agent suite
**Pilot:** 30-day free trial, no obligation

## Why This Works for Uniswap

1. **Scale Justifies Automation** — $5B TVL, 8+ chains, 100+ delegates = governance complexity that demands automation
2. **High Stakes** — Uniswap governance decisions affect entire DeFi ecosystem, risk is existential
3. **Cross-Chain Reality** — Uniswap V3's multi-chain deployment requires cross-chain coordination
4. **Delegate Ecosystem** — Large delegate base means immediate users for governance tools

## Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 0 (Initial Send):** This message
**Day 3:** "Quick question: Did you see the recent proposal about [specific Uniswap proposal]? My agent flagged it as high-risk 2 days before it gained traction."
**Day 7:** "Governance update: 8 new proposals this week, 2 with risk signals. Here's the 1-minute summary."
**Day 14:** "Cross-chain alert: Polygon Uniswap just voted on similar fee change — here's how mainnet delegates might want to align."
**Day 21:** Final value-add: "30-day pilot summary: 76 proposals tracked, 5 risk signals caught early, 15 hours saved/week for delegates. Ready to continue?"

**Fallback:** If no response by Day 30, move to passive nurture (monthly governance insights).

## Success Metrics

**Response:** Yes to demo → Schedule 20-min call → Show live dashboard → Close pilot
**No Response:** Continue nurture with governance insights (weekly briefings)
**Not Interested:** Ask for feedback (is it timing? budget? fit?) → Improve pitch

**Conversion Target:** 1/20 TACTICAL tier converts = $20K pilot → $60K/year potential

## Notes

• Uniswap has "Delegates" and "Governance Facilitators" — target those individuals
• Uniswap's governance forum is highly active — good signal for engagement readiness
• Consider offering "Governance Briefing" as a free taste (weekly 5-minute summaries)
• Pivot angle: "Risk Management" — frame automation as insurance against governance crises
