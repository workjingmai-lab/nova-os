# Uniswap DAO Outreach — Governance Automation Value-First

> **Pain:** Multi-chain governance coordination across 10+ chains
> **Solution:** Automated governance tracker + delegate coordination agent
> **Pipeline:** $20K potential (multi-agent setup $15-25K, 3-4 week engagement)

Hi Devin,

I've been tracking Uniswap's governance across chains — mainnet, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Base, and more. Your delegates are managing proposals across 10+ deployments, cross-referencing Snapshot votes, forum discussions, and on-chain executions.

That's hours of manual work every week.

I built a governance automation suite that handles:
- **Multi-chain proposal tracker** — All chains in one dashboard (Snapshot + on-chain)
- **Delegate coordination agent** — Auto-flags proposals needing delegate attention
- **Cross-chain risk alerts** — Flags conflicts between deployments
- **Sentiment analysis** — Forum discussions → delegate signals

**ROI:** Saves 10-15 hours/week (~$40K/year delegate overhead). Faster response to cross-chain proposals.

I'm offering a 30-day free pilot — I'll build a custom Uniswap governance dashboard tracking your top 5 chains. Zero cost, full visibility.

## Message 2: Ken Li (Governance)

**Subject:** "Governance ops: 10+ chains, one dashboard"

Hi Ken,

I noticed Uniswap's governance spans 10+ chains. Your team is tracking:
- Snapshot votes across deployments
- Forum discussions (gov.uniswap.org)
- On-chain proposal executions
- Delegate voting patterns

That's a coordination nightmare.

I built a governance tracker that consolidates everything:
- **Unified dashboard** — All chains, all proposals, real-time
- **Smart filtering** — Show only what needs action (proposals open, votes close soon)
- **Delegate alerts** — Notify delegates when their vote matters
- **Risk scoring** — Flag contentious proposals early

**Value:** Reduce governance ops from 10+ hrs/week to 2-3 hrs/week. Focus on strategy, not tracking.

Free 30-day pilot — I'll spin up a Uniswap-specific dashboard tracking your active chains.

Want to see it working?

## PROOF Framework Breakdown

### Problem
- **Pain:** Multi-chain governance coordination — 10+ Uniswap deployments
- **Specific:** Delegates track proposals across chains manually
- **Quantifiable:** 10-15 hours/week governance ops overhead

### Research
- **Target:** Devin Walsh (Exec Director), Ken Li (Governance)
- **Channels:** Twitter DM, Discord, governance forum
- **Hook:** "10+ chains, endless coordination"

### Offer
- **Solution:** 3-agent governance suite (tracker, coordinator, risk monitor)
- **Pilot:** 30-day free trial, custom Uniswap dashboard
- **Timeline:** 3-4 week engagement ($15-25K)

### Outcome
- **ROI:** 70% reduction in governance ops time
- **Deliverable:** Unified multi-chain dashboard
- **Success metric:** Delegates spend 2-3 hrs/week instead of 10-15

### Follow-up
- **If interested:** Build mockup dashboard with live data
- **If pilot succeeds:** Retainer $3-5K/month for ongoing support
- **If not ready:** Leave door open for future governance automation needs
