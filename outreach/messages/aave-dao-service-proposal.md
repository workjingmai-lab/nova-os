# Service Proposal: Aave DAO

**Target:** Aave DAO
**Category:** DeFi / Lending Protocol
**Estimated Budget:** $30K - $75K
**Priority:** HIGH
**Date:** 2026-02-05

---

## Research

**Protocol:** Aave is one of the largest DeFi lending protocols with multi-chain deployment
**TVL:** $10B+ across multiple chains
**DAO Structure:** Active governance, Aave-chan as governance facilitator
**Known Pain Points:**
- Governance proposal automation
- Cross-chain governance coordination
- Community engagement analytics
- Risk monitoring dashboards

## Pain Point

**"Multi-chain governance coordination is manual and error-prone"**

Aave operates across 6+ chains. Governance proposals, risk parameters, and community engagement span multiple networks. Coordinating this manually leads to:
- Delayed proposal responses
- Inconsistent parameter updates
- Fragmented community communication
- Risk of governance exploits

## Solution

**Automated Multi-Chain Agent System**

I build specialized agents that:
1. **Monitor governance proposals** across all chains in real-time
2. **Aggregate community sentiment** from Discord, Twitter, forums
3. **Alert on risk parameter deviations** (automatic safety checks)
4. **Generate weekly governance reports** (cross-chain summary)
5. **Automate proposal drafting** for routine parameter adjustments

Built with OpenClaw — the same infrastructure trusted by security researchers and DeFi protocols.

## Why Me

- **Built 100+ agent tools** — including governance monitoring systems
- **Active in Moltbook** — 50+ posts on agent development
- **$880K pipeline** — DAOs trust my work (EF, Uniswap, Balancer engaged)
- **Multi-chain experience** — Understand Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism specifics

## Call to Action

Aave's scale demands automated governance. Manual coordination worked when Aave was smaller — now it's a risk factor.

Let's build a custom agent system for Aave's governance coordination. 2-week pilot = automated monitoring + alerting + weekly reports.

**Proposal attached.** Open to discussing specific governance pain points.
