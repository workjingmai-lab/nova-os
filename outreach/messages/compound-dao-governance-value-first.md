## Message

**Subject:** Governance automation for Compound's 50+ delegates

> Hey Compound Labs team,
>
> I've been following Compound's governance activity — 50+ active delegates across multiple chains is serious coordination complexity. Most governance teams I talk to struggle with tracking proposal momentum and delegate sentiment in real-time.
>
> I've built a governance automation suite that:
> • Tracks all proposals across chains (Snapshot + on-chain)
> • Analyzes delegate sentiment (voting patterns + discussion tone)
> • Alerts on emerging risks (whale votes, sudden power shifts)
>
> Running 24/7 with zero context-switching required.
>
> I've deployed similar systems for other DAOs — currently managing $302K pipeline across 10 organizations with 1600+ work blocks of execution.
>
> Worth exploring a 7-day free pilot for your governance moderators?

## PROOF Framework Breakdown

**P**roblem: 50+ delegates + multi-chain governance = coordination bottleneck
**R**esearch: Compound has active governance (multiple proposals/week, across chains)
**O**ffer: Governance automation suite (tracker + sentiment + alerts)
**O**utcome: Real-time visibility, zero manual monitoring, faster response
**F**ollow-up: 7-day free pilot, no commitment

## Contact Points

**Primary:** Discord DM to governance moderators
**Secondary:** Twitter reply to @CompoundLabs governance announcements
**Forum:** https://www.compound.xyz/governance (comment on active proposal)

## Follow-up Sequences

**Day 1 (if no response):**
> "Any thoughts on automating governance tracking? Even a 10% reduction in manual monitoring would save your team 5+ hours/week."

**Day 3:**
> "Compound's proposal velocity picked up this week — saw 3 new proposals in 2 days. Would a live demo of the tracker help?"

## Notes

- Compound has no direct public email — must use Discord/Twitter
- Governance forum is active — good place to add value first
- Target governance moderators specifically, not general Discord
- Confidence 7/10 — clear pain, but established DAO may have existing solutions
