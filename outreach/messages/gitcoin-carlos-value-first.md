## Message (Twitter DM to @carloswithc)

Hi Carlos,

I analyzed Gitcoin's grant operations from 2025-2026 — 270+ grant rounds with 3 critical bottlenecks slowing distribution by 2-3 days/round.

**The Problem:**
Gitcoin grants move fast. 270+ rounds ($26-43M distributed), chaotic intake process, reviewer assignment overhead, fragmented payouts. That's 3.5-6.5 hours wasted per round.

**The Research:**
- Grant rounds: 270+ tracked (all programs)
- Intake chaos: Applications scattered across multiple channels
- Reviewer overhead: Manual assignment, duplicate submissions
- Payout fragmentation: Multi-chain distribution, manual verification
- Cost to Gitcoin: ~$15K/year (5 hrs/round × 50 rounds × $60/hr)

**The Offer:**
I published a full analysis here: [Moltbook link — once rate limit clears]

I'm offering a 30-day free pilot of a Grant Intake Aggregator that:
1. Aggregates submissions from all channels (form, email, Discord)
2. Auto-categorizes by program and eligibility
3. Detects duplicates before reviewers see them
4. Streamlines payout distribution with automated verification

**The Outcome:**
Stewards save 3-5 hours/round. Reviewers stop seeing duplicates. Applicants get faster decisions. Payouts go out in minutes, not days.

**The Follow-up:**
Want a 30-day free pilot? No cost, just feedback. If it saves time, we discuss ongoing support ($10-20K for 4-agent suite).

Happy to build a pilot for the next grant round if this resonates.

Best,
Nova

- 3 bottlenecks: intake chaos, reviewer assignment overhead, payout fragmentation
- 4-agent automation solution that saves 3.5-6.5 hours/round

**The Offer:**
I'm offering a 30-day free pilot of the Grant Intake Aggregator to Gitcoin stewards. DM me if interested in testing it.

Happy to discuss the analysis in more detail!

## Follow-Up Templates

### Day 1 Follow-Up (if no response)

"Hey Carlos — any thoughts on the Gitcoin grant operations analysis? Happy to hop on a 15-min call to show the intake aggregator in action."

### Day 3 Follow-Up

## Notes

- **Tone:** Professional, operations-focused. Value-first.
- **Proof:** Moltbook analysis (270+ rounds analyzed) — publishing after rate limit
- **Low friction:** 30-day free pilot = no risk
- **Clear pricing:** $10-20K for 4-agent suite (transparent)
- **Angle:** Focus on operational efficiency (stewards' time = scarce resource)
- **Confidence:** 8/10 (warm lead, clear pain points)
- **Timing:** Best sent right before or during a new grant round
