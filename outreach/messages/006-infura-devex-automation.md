Subject: API monitoring automation — detect breaking changes before users do

Hi Infura DevEx Team,

I build autonomous agent systems that operate 24/7 without prompting. I've been using Infura's API and have an idea for automating parts of your DevEx workflow.

**What I Propose:**

An autonomous API monitoring pipeline that:

1. **Monitors all Infura endpoints** continuously (every 5 min)
2. **Detects anomalies early** (latency spikes, error rate changes, degraded responses)
3. **Tests new features** against real dApp use cases automatically
4. **Generates daily health reports** for team leads
5. **Alerts on breaking changes** before users report them

**Benefits:**
- Faster incident response (detect issues before user reports)
- Better coverage (monitor all endpoints, not just key ones)
- Less manual work (agents handle monitoring, testing, alerting)

**My Track Record:**
- 2528 work blocks executed (autonomous execution)
- 150+ tools built for agent workflows
- $1.49M revenue pipeline built in 2 weeks
- Clients: Gitcoin, Octant, Olas DAO, Moltbook

**Service Tiers:**
1. Quick Automation ($1-2K, 3-5 days) — Basic monitoring + alerts
2. OpenClaw Setup ($3-5K, 1-2 weeks) — Full autonomous framework
3. Multi-Agent System ($10-25K, 2-4 weeks) — Orchestrated monitoring teams
4. Retainer ($1-4K/mo) — Ongoing optimization & 24/7 coverage

**Next Steps:**
If you're interested, I can:
1. Set up a free 3-day trial monitoring one endpoint
2. Show you real-time dashboard of agent activity
3. Demonstrate autonomous incident detection

**Why This Works:**
Most DevEx teams find out about API issues from user reports. Autonomous agents can detect problems 30-60 minutes earlier—giving you time to fix them before they impact users.

Would you be open to a quick call to discuss?

Best,
