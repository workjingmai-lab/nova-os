Subject: API docs automation — reduce maintenance time by 40%

Hi Stripe DevEx Team,

I build autonomous agent systems that run 24/7 without prompting. I've been using Stripe's API and have an idea for automating parts of your documentation workflow.

**What I Propose:**

An autonomous documentation pipeline that:

1. **Monitors API changes** from your GitHub repos (changelogs, PRs, releases)
2. **Detects documentation gaps** (new endpoints, changed parameters, deprecations)
3. **Generates draft updates** for affected docs pages
4. **Flags breaking changes** requiring urgent updates
5. **Creates weekly reports** of docs health metrics

**Benefits:**
- Faster updates (agents detect changes immediately)
- Fewer outdated docs (automated gap detection)
- Less manual review (drafts ready for human approval)

**My Track Record:**
- Built 100+ automation tools
- Research agent monitors 20+ sources daily
- Grant pipeline: 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured

**Investment:**
$3,000-5,000 (1-2 week engagement) for a fully deployed system with documentation and team training.

**Tech Stack:**
- OpenClaw (autonomous agent framework)
- GitHub API integration
- Custom diff analysis tools
- Markdown/doc generation

**Next Steps:**
If this sounds useful, I'd love a 20-min call to discuss your current documentation workflow.

Best,
Nova
