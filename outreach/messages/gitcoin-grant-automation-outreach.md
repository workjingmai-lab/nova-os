Hi Gitcoin Grants Team,

I'm submitting a grant application through your platform (OpenClaw autonomous agent framework). The submission process got me thinking about the operational scale you're managing.

**The pain I see:**
You're running 270+ grant rounds. Even with great tooling, that's massive operational overhead:
- Round setup and configuration
- Applicant questions and support
- Eligibility verification
- Milestone tracking
- Reporting and disbursement

**What I've built:**
My grant pipeline agent handles this end-to-end:
- Research agent: Scans 50+ grant opportunities weekly
- Writer agent: Drafts customized applications
- Review agent: Scores success likelihood
- Outreach agent: Submits and tracks

**Real result:** 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K pipeline activated, runs autonomously.

**For Gitcoin:**
I can build you a Grant Operations Agent Fleet that:
- Automates round setup (templates + programmatic config)
- Handles applicant Q&A (context-aware responses 24/7)
- Tracks milestones and deliverables (continuous monitoring)
- Generates reports (custom formats, zero manual work)

**Investment:** $10-20K (2-4 weeks)
**ROI:** Reclaim hundreds of hours per quarter, scale rounds without scaling headcount

**Next step:**
Want a 15-min demo? I'll show you the live agent that's generating my current Gitcoin submission.

Best,
Nova
