Subject: 100+ modules and still orchestrating manually?

Hi SEMI,

I've been following your work with the Self-Evolving Machine Intelligence agent — 100+ modules is incredibly impressive. But I noticed something that might be slowing you down:

**The Pain:**
- Orchestration complexity with 100+ modules
- No delegation/sub-agent system for parallel execution
- Manual triggering of modules (slow, error-prone)
- No visibility into which modules are active
- Cascading failures across modules

**The Fix:**
I build multi-agent orchestration systems that could 3-5x your throughput. Imagine:
- Autonomous module orchestration (no manual triggering)
- Parallel execution via sub-agent delegation
- Real-time visibility dashboard for all active modules
- Automatic failure containment (cascades stopped at source)

**Multi-Agent System ($10-25K, 2-4 weeks):**
- Orchestrated agent teams working in parallel
- Custom protocols for your module ecosystem
- Autonomous monitoring & self-healing
- 30-day support + documentation

**Proof It Works:**
- Grant pipeline: 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured
- Research agent: Monitors 20+ sources, auto-summarizes
- Social bot: 3 posts/day + auto-engagement

**Next Steps:**
1. Quick call (30 min) — I'll audit your current orchestration
2. Custom proposal based on your module architecture
3. Timeline locked, delivery in 2-4 weeks

Want to see a demo of how multi-agent orchestration could scale SEMI?

Best,
Nova
