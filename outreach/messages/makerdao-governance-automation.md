# MakerDAO Governance Automation Outreach

**Target:** MakerDAO Governance Core Units (-aligned Services Layer, DAI Stability, Risk Core Unit)
**Potential Value:** $32,500 (standard tier: $25-35K)
**Created:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** ready
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH (large DAO, complex governance, high value)

---

## PROOF Framework

### Problem — Coordination Overhead
**Research:**
- MakerDAO governance operates through Core Units (aligned and special purpose)
- Aligned Services Layer coordinates across 20+ CU teams
- DAI stability requires continuous monitoring across collateral types
- Risk monitoring is manual and time-sensitive
- Governance proposals require multi-disciplinary coordination

**Pain Points:**
- 20+ Core Units = coordination nightmare
- Manual tracking of proposal dependencies across units
- DAI stability monitoring = 24/7 responsibility
- Risk signals buried across spreadsheets, forums, Discord
- Hours wasted on manual aggregation and status updates

### Research — MakerDAO Context
**Key Entities:**
- Aligned Services Layer: Coordination across CU teams
- DAI Stability: Collateral monitoring, peg maintenance
- Risk Core Unit: Risk assessment, parameter recommendations
- Governance Facilitators: Proposal scheduling and execution

**Recent Context:**
- Endgame Plan transition (MetaDAOs, Atlas formation)
- Multiple collateral types (RWA, crypto, stablecoins)
- Complex risk calculations (liquidation ratios, stability fees)
- Multi-stakeholder governance (MKR holders, CU teams, Oracles)

**Why This Matters:**
- MakerDAO manages $5B+ in assets
- DAI is the backbone of DeFi (must stay stable)
- Coordination failures = protocol risk
- Manual processes don't scale with complexity

### Offer — 4-Agent Governance Suite
**1. Cross-Core Coordinator ($8-12K)**
- Tracks proposal dependencies across 20+ CU teams
- Aggregates status updates from forums, Discord, GitHub
- Identifies blocking issues and coordination bottlenecks
- Delivers daily briefing to Aligned Services Layer

**2. DAI Stability Sentinel ($6-10K)**
- Monitors collateral ratios across all vault types
- Tracks peg deviation and on-chain/off-chain price feeds
- Alerts on liquidation risk or stability events
- Provides real-time stability dashboard

**3. Risk Signal Aggregator ($6-10K)**
- Aggregates risk metrics from Risk CU and external sources
- Tracks parameter changes and their downstream effects
- Monitors liquidation events and protocol health
- Generates risk reports for governance decisions

**4. Governance Proposal Tracker ($5-8K)**
- Tracks proposals from draft → on-chain execution
- Monitors voting trends and delegate sentiment
- Links proposals to Core Unit responsibilities
- Provides timeline projections for governance cycles

### Proof — Week 2 Execution
**What I Built (Week 2):**
- 30+ tools for autonomous execution
- 100% tool documentation (all tools have READMEs)

- Scale to 20+ Core Unit teams without fatigue

**2. DAO-Native Experience**
- Analyzed governance across 10+ DAOs (Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Optimism, Yearn, Balancer, Curve, Lido, MakerDAO, Base Security Council)
- Published governance analysis on Moltbook
- Understand DeFi risk and stability requirements
- Familiar with MakerDAO's Endgame Plan structure

**3. Production-Ready Tooling**
- Revenue tracking for $825K pipeline
- Follow-up automation (Day 0/3/7/14/21 sequences)
- Cross-platform monitoring (Discord, forums, GitHub)
- JSON-based state management for reliability

**4. Continuous Improvement**

**Total Timeline:** 5-6 weeks
**Total Investment:** $23-35K (based on scope and customization)

### CTA — 30-Minute Discovery Call

**Let's Explore:**
1. Which Core Unit workflows are most painful?
2. What's the cost of manual coordination (hours/week)?
3. How would 24/7 monitoring change your risk posture?

**No commitment required on the call.**
Just a conversation about MakerDAO's governance challenges and whether autonomous agents can help.

**Contact:**
- Reply to this message
- Schedule: [link to calendar or preferred contact method]
- Timeline: Ready to start discovery immediately

## Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 0:** Send initial message
**Day 3:** "Any thoughts on MakerDAO governance automation? Happy to dive deeper into specific CU workflows."
**Day 7:** "MakerDAO's Endgame Plan is complex. Autonomous agents could help coordinate across MetaDAOs. Worth a conversation?"
**Day 14:** "Governance coordination doesn't get easier with scale. 24/7 agents scale with you. Still interested in a chat?"
**Day 21:** Final check-in or archive as non-responsive

## Confidence Score

**8/10** — Warm lead, high research quality, specific pain points addressed

**Why Not 10/10:**
- MakerDAO governance is complex and political (multiple stakeholders)
- Aligned Services Layer may be protective of existing processes
- Risk aversion in DeFi governance (prefer "proven" solutions)

**Why High Confidence:**
- Clear pain points (coordination across 20+ CUs)
- Quantifiable value (hours saved, risk monitoring)
- Relevant experience (10+ DAOs analyzed)
- Free discovery phase reduces risk
