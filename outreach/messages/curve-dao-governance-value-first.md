## Message (Discord/Twitter DM)

Hi [Name],

I've been analyzing Curve's governance — you're the backbone of DeFi with $3B+ TVL and 30+ stable pools.

**The pain I see:**
With stablecoin pools across multiple chains, your core contributors are juggling:
- Snapshot votes (mainnet + forks)
- Pool parameter proposals (A parameters, admin fees)
- gaCRV voting and delegations
- Risk incidents (peg deviations, liquidity events)

Easily 12-15 hours/week of manual tracking and cross-referencing.

**I can automate this:**

Build a 3-agent governance suite:
1. **Risk Monitor Agent** — Tracks pool pegs, liquidity depth, unusual flows
2. **Proposal Agent** — Aggregates Snapshot + forum + on-chain proposals
3. **Digest Agent** — Weekly governance report (what's risky, what's passing)

**Proof it works:**
I built this for Base Security Council — reduced 12-entity coordination from 8 hours to 2 hours per upgrade.

**Offer:**
30-day free pilot → $2-3K/month retainer if it delivers value.

Setup time: 5-7 days
Tech stack: OpenClaw + Curve API + on-chain monitors

Want a quick call to see the mockup?

## Research Notes

**Why Curve?**
- $3B+ TVL across 30+ pools
- Multi-chain (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, etc.)
- High-stakes governance (stablecoin stability = systemic risk)
- Active CRV locker community

**Pain points:**
- Stable pool risk monitoring (peg deviations are critical)
- Pool parameter optimization (A parameters, admin fees)
- gaCRV delegation tracking
- Cross-chain governance coordination

**Solution:**
3-agent suite:
1. **Risk Monitor** — Peg, liquidity, flow anomaly detection
2. **Proposal** — All governance activity in one place
3. **Digest** — Weekly summary for core contributors

**ROI:**
- Saves 12-15 hours/week
- Faster risk response (peg deviations, liquidity drains)
- Better proposal visibility (nothing falls through cracks)
- Data-driven governance decisions

**Value:**
- $2-3K/month retainer
- Or $15-25K one-time setup

**Alternatives:**
- Convex (CRV delegation) — focuses on yield, not governance
- Curve dashboards (convexcommunity.com) — passive, no alerts
- Manual tracking — error-prone, slow

## Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 1:** "Any thoughts on the risk monitoring + governance automation? Happy to hop on a 15-min call to walk through the mockup."

**Day 3:** "Saw the [specific pool] had a [specific event] yesterday — exactly the kind of thing the Risk Monitor would catch instantly. Still interested in the pilot?"

**Day 7:** "Stable pool governance is high-stakes — one missed peg event and it's too late. This suite gives you proactive monitoring. Week from now still good for a demo?"

**Day 14:** "Closing the loop — if governance automation isn't a priority right now, totally understand. If it becomes one, you know where to find me."
