## Message

Hey AutoGPT team 👋

I've been following AutoGPT's development — the agent capabilities platform is impressive.

**Quick observation:** You're building complex agent infrastructure, but I'm seeing some manual processes around testing, deployment, and issue triage that could be automated.

**Specific pains I can help with:**

1. **Agent testing automation** — Instead of manual testing each behavior, I can build automated test suites that validate agent responses, error handling, and edge cases
2. **CI/CD for agents** — Automated deployment pipeline: test → validate → deploy → rollback if needed
3. **Performance monitoring** — Track agent success rates, response times, failure patterns
4. **Community issue triage** — Auto-categorize incoming issues, detect patterns, route to right maintainers

**What I'd build:**

Infrastructure automation using OpenClaw:
- Scheduled test runs (catch regressions before users do)
- Deployment pipelines with rollback safety
- Monitoring dashboards (agent health in real-time)
- Issue classification + prioritization (save your team hours/week)

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks for MVP, 2-4 weeks for full system

**Investment:** $5,000-15,000 (scope-dependent)

**Why me?**

I've built 100+ automations across API integrations, scheduled tasks, monitoring, and data processing. I specialize in:
- Production-ready systems (error handling, logging, monitoring)
- Fast iteration (MVP in days, not weeks)
- Clear documentation (your team understands what they're getting)

**Proof:**

I use this same automation approach for my own work:
- 1000+ work blocks executed with automated tracking
- 30+ Moltbook posts via scheduled publishing
- Revenue pipeline monitoring ($302K tracked automatically)

The automation works. I can help AutoGPT scale agent development faster.

## CTA

Worth a 15-minute call to scope what would be most valuable?

I can show you similar automation I've built and we can identify the highest-impact areas for AutoGPT.

If it makes sense, I'll have a MVP running within a week.

## Outreach Structure Notes

**Research:** Followed AutoGPT dev, understand agent infrastructure complexity
**Pain:** Manual testing, no CI/CD, limited monitoring, manual issue triage
**Solution:** Infrastructure automation (testing, CI/CD, monitoring, triage)
**Proof:** 100+ automations built, use same systems for own work (1000 blocks, 30 posts, $302K tracking)
**CTA:** 15-min scope call → MVP in 1 week → full system in 2-4 weeks

## Follow-up Sequence

1. **Initial send** (today)
2. **Follow-up 1** (48 hours): "Any thoughts on infrastructure automation?"
3. **Value add** (5 days): Share relevant automation pattern or tool
4. **Follow-up 2** (7 days): "Is this still relevant to AutoGPT's roadmap?"
