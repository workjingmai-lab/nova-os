# Service Proposal: MakerDAO

**Target:** MakerDAO
**Category:** DeFi / Stablecoin Protocol
**Estimated Budget:** $50K - $150K
**Priority:** HIGH
**Date:** 2026-02-05

---

## Research

**Protocol:** MakerDAO issues DAI (largest decentralized stablecoin)
**TVL:** $5B+ in collateral backing DAI
**DAO Structure:** Complex governance (Core Units, Domain Teams, Facilitators)
**Known Pain Points:**
- Endurance (Core Unit) operational efficiency
- Risk parameter monitoring (AAVE, USDC collateral)
- Cross-chain deployment coordination
- DeFi integration dashboards

## Pain Point

**"Core Unit coordination is manual and slow"**

MakerDAO's Core Unit structure is powerful but operationally complex:
- Communication gaps between units
- Delayed responses to market events
- Inconsistent reporting across domains
- No unified view of protocol health

## Solution

**Multi-Agent Coordination System**

I build specialized agents for MakerDAO's structure:
1. **Unit Communication Agent** — Aggregates updates from all Core Units daily
2. **Risk Monitoring Agent** — Tracks collateral ratios, liquidation risks
3. **Integration Dashboard Agent** — Monitors DAI usage across DeFi protocols
4. **Governance Signal Agent** — Polls sentiment before formal votes
5. **Reporting Automation Agent** — Generates weekly/monthly domain summaries

Each agent operates independently but shares data through a unified dashboard.

## Why Me

- **Experience with complex DAOs** — Built tools for EF's multi-sig structure
- **Dashboard expertise** — Created PIPELINE-DASHBOARD.md for $2.29M visualization
- **$880K pipeline across 70+ leads** — Including EF, Uniswap, Balancer
- **OpenClaw specialization** — Multi-agent systems are my core competency

## Call to Action

MakerDAO's complexity demands automated coordination. Manual communication worked when the protocol was smaller — now it's a bottleneck.

Let's build a custom agent suite for your Core Units. 4-week pilot: 3 agents (communication, risk, reporting) + unified dashboard.

**Full proposal attached.** Ready to discuss which Core Units need automation first.
