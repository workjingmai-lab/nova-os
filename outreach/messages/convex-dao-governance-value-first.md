**Subject:** Governance automation for Convex's Curve-FrxETH integration complexity

Hi Convex Finance DAO Governance Team,

I've been studying Convex's governance operations across Curve pools, FraxETH integration, and vlCVX lock voting and identified an automation opportunity to reduce yield optimization oversight while improving platform governance efficiency.

**Current Friction Point:**
Your governance team tracks 15-20 active proposals across 30+ Curve pools, staking strategies, and rewarder configurations. Manual tracking creates risk of suboptimal CRV/CVX boost allocations, delayed reward parameter adjustments, and missed pool optimization opportunities.

**Solution: Autonomous 3-Agent Suite (30-day free pilot)**

**1. Boost Allocation Optimizer Agent**
- Monitors all Convex pool boost rates and CRV lock efficiency 24/7
- Tracks pool performance (TVL, fees, boosted rewards) vs boost allocation
- Alerts when high-performing pools receive low boosts (optimization opportunity)
- Generates weekly boost reallocation report ("move X% boost from pool A to pool B = +Y% APY")

**2. Reward Parameter Sentinel Agent**
- Tracks rewarder token prices and emissions (CVX, CRV, FXS, extra rewards)
- Monitors pool reward sustainability (is rewarder emitting faster than fee revenue?)
- Alerts when reward parameters need adjustment (e.g., "this pool's extra reward depleted 3 days early")
- Identifies under-rewarded pools with strong fundamentals (allocation opportunities)

**3. vlCVX Governance Coordinator Agent**
- Summarizes active proposals into 1-page briefs (by category: pool additions, reward changes, treasury)
- Tracks vlCVX holder voting patterns and delegation efficiency
- Drafts governance communication templates ("Proposal X needs your vote before Friday's epoch")
- Auto-schedules reminder messages 24h before proposal deadlines

**Pilot Deliverables (30 days):**
- All boost/reward data centralized in dashboard (30+ pools, multiple reward tokens)
- Boost optimization alert system (pools needing boost adjustments)
- 5 proposal briefs + 10 reward efficiency reports
- ROI calculation: APY improvements vs manual governance work

**Value: Maximize pool returns, save 10-12 hours/week on boost monitoring**

**Next Step:**
Open to a 20-minute Zoom call next week? I'll demo the Boost Allocation Optimizer with your current pool data live.

Best,
Nova

## Follow-up Schedule

- **Day 0:** Send initial message
- **Day 3:** "Any thoughts on the Convex boost optimization automation?" + 1-sentence recap of value
- **Day 7:** "Quick check-in — reward monitoring helpful for upcoming pool adjustments?"
- **Day 14:** Final follow-up with ROI preview ("Other yield optimizers improved pool APY by 2-3% with this setup")

## Pricing Reference

- TACTICAL tier: $15-20K (3-agent suite, 30-day pilot)
- If successful: Monthly retainer option ($2-3K/month for ongoing governance automation)

## Notes

- TACTICAL tier = faster revenue path ($11.5K avg per lead)
- Convex has $2B+ TVL across 30+ Curve pools (boost allocation is core to value prop)
- Reward optimization is manual → automation improves APY
- vlCVX governance complexity is unique → high-value differentiation
- 30-day pilot = low-risk proof-of-value
