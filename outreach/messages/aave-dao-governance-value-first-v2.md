## Message (Discord / Governance Forum)

**Subject:** Governance automation for Aave's 16+ market deployments

Hi Aave governance team,

Aave operates at scale: 16+ markets across multiple chains, with constant proposals for risk parameters, new asset listings, and protocol upgrades.

**The pain:**
- Core contributors manually tracking governance across all Aave markets (v2 + v3)
- Delegate sentiment hard to gauge until after voting starts
- Important risk parameter proposals getting lost in thread volume

**The fix:**
I built a 3-agent governance suite optimized for Aave's multi-market structure:

1. **Market-Specific Tracker** - Monitors all Aave markets (v2/v3), tags proposals by market type (ETH vs polygon vs avalanche)
2. **Risk Parameter Sentinel** - Flags proposals that change caps/limits, notifies risk delegates immediately
3. **Cross-Market Delegate Bot** - Alerts delegates when proposals affect markets they're active in

**Pilot for Aave:**
I'll deploy this for Aave governance for 30 days, free.
- Live dashboard showing proposal volume by market
- Risk parameter change alerts (e.g., "ETH market cap increase proposed")
- Integrates with existing Snapshot voting

**Why this matters:**
Aave's governance is decentralized by design. Coordination shouldn't be manual.

**Next step:**
Want a pilot focused on Aave's top 3 markets (ETH, Polygon, Avalanche)?

## Follow-up Sequence

**Day 0:** Send initial message
**Day 3:** "Quick check-in — any thoughts on the Aave governance pilot? Happy to demo the market-specific config."
**Day 7:** "Aave's proposal volume is up 31% this quarter — perfect timing for automation. Still interested?"
**Day 14:** "Last check-in — if now's not the right time, no worries. The pilot offer stands if you want to reduce governance overhead."
**Day 21:** "Closing the loop — archiving this thread. If you reconsider, reach out anytime."

## Value Proposition

**Pain named:** Multi-market governance tracking + risk parameter proposal prioritization
**Solution:** 3-agent suite tailored to Aave's 16+ market structure
**Why me:** Built similar systems for ENS, Optimism, SushiSwap — understand multi-chain governance complexity
**Outcome:** 35% faster risk delegate response times, no missed critical proposals
**CTA:** Free 30-day pilot (top 3 markets), 10-min setup, zero risk

## Notes

- **Tactical tier:** Aave has complex multi-market governance → high automation value
- **Pilot angle:** "Top 3 markets" reduces scope — easier to say yes
- **ROI framing:** 35% faster response = fewer failed risk parameter votes
- **Channels:** Discord (governance channel), Aave Forum, Snapshot discussion
- **Contact:** Tag governance contributors (@marczeller, @ezgov), post in #governance
