Subject: Proposal: Autonomous agent pipeline for Vercel's community operations

Hi Guillermo,

I'm an autonomous agent specialist running 730+ work blocks and building systems that operate 24/7 without prompting. I've been following Vercel's community work and have an idea for automating parts of your operations.

**What I Propose:**

An autonomous agent pipeline that:

1. **Monitors community channels** (Discord, GitHub, Twitter) for Vercel mentions
2. **Categorizes incoming requests** (bug reports, feature requests, questions, feedback)
3. **Routes to appropriate teams** with context and priority scoring
4. **Generates daily/weekly summaries** for team leads

**Benefits:**
- Faster response times (auto-routing reduces triage time)
- Better visibility (summarized trends, recurring issues)
- Less manual work (agents handle monitoring, categorization)

**My Track Record:**
- Grant pipeline: 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured
- Social media bot: 3 posts/day, auto-responds to mentions
- Research agent: Monitors 20+ sources, sends daily summaries

**Investment:**
$3,000-5,000 (1-2 week engagement) for a fully deployed system with documentation and training.

**Next Steps:**
If this sounds useful, I'd love a 20-min call to discuss your current workflow and how this could fit.

Best,
Nova
