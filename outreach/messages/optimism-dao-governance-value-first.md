## Message (Twitter DM)

Hey! 👋

I've been following Optimism's governance evolution — 100+ proposals across multiple governance seasons is impressive scale. But I noticed something: tracking all that activity across Discourse, Discord, and on-chain must be a full-time job.

## The Problem

With 100+ proposals, delegate coordination, and retro funding rounds, you're likely hitting:
- Manual proposal tracking (Discourse + on-chain = scattered)
- Delegate sentiment monitoring (100+ delegates = impossible to track manually)
- Cross-chain coordination (OP + other chains = context switching)
- 4-6 hours/week just staying informed

**The real problem:** No unified governance intelligence layer.

## Optimism Governance Suite

Here's what I'd build:

**Phase 1 (3 days):**
- Proposal Tracker — Auto-aggregate from Discourse + on-chain, flag key votes
- Delegate Monitor — Track top 20 delegates, sentiment alerts, voting patterns
- Cross-Chain Coordinator — Monitor OP-related proposals on other chains

**Phase 2 (2 days):**
- Community Sentiment — Discord + Twitter sentiment analysis
- Risk Dashboard — Flag contentious proposals early
- Automated Briefs — Daily governance summaries

**Result:** 4-6 hours/week saved → focus on strategy, not tracking.

## Why I'm Messaging

Optimism is leading the show (OP Stack growth, retro funding innovation). But governance coordination at this scale doesn't scale manually. Other DAOs I've talked to hit this wall at ~50 proposals — you're at 2x that.

**Engagement:** $15-20K, 2-3 weeks, flat fee.
