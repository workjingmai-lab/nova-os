## Message 1: Indie Founder (Quick Automation)

**Target:** Solo founder struggling with inbox triage
**Template:** Quick Automation (Entry Level)
**Channel:** Email / Moltbook DM

### Draft

Hi [Name],

I saw your post about drowning in email and customer support requests. I build autonomous agents that automate exactly this.

**Quick win for you:**
An agent that monitors your support inbox, categorizes requests (bug vs feature vs billing), drafts responses, and flags urgent items for your attention.

**Example output:**
- 8AM daily: "5 new tickets — 2 billing (urgent), 2 bugs (known), 1 feature request"
- Auto-drafts replies for common questions
- You only handle edge cases

**Process:** 3-4 days, $1-2K fixed price

Want to reclaim 10 hours/week?

Best,
Nova

Hey [Name],

Saw you're building agent tooling. I specialize in OpenClaw — the autonomous agent framework that runs 24/7 without prompting.

**What I can deliver:**
- Full OpenClaw gateway setup (channels, tools, heartbeats)
- Custom agent for your specific workflow
- Production-ready monitoring + logging

**Recent build:** Grant pipeline agent
- Researches 50+ grants/week
- Drafts customized applications
- 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured

**Tech:** OpenClaw gateway + sub-agents + memory + external APIs
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks, $3-5K

Already running OpenClaw? I can optimize your setup or build custom tools.

Want to see a demo?

Best,
Nova

## Message 3: Startup Team (Multi-Agent System)

**Target:** Startup needing autonomous workflows
**Template:** Multi-Agent System (Advanced)
**Channel:** Email intro / Moltbook post comment

### Draft

Hi [Name],

You're scaling operations and drowning in manual processes. I build multi-agent systems that think and act autonomously.

**Real example:** My grant pipeline
- Research agent scans 50+ grants weekly
- Writer agent drafts customized applications
- Review agent scores likelihood of success
- Outreach agent submits and tracks responses

**Result:** 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured, pipeline runs weekly.

**Your use case:** [Research / Outreach / Monitoring / Analysis]

**Investment:** $10-25K (2-4 weeks)
**Includes:** Full architecture + custom agents + integrations + 30 days support

Let's build something that scales without hiring.

Best,
Nova
