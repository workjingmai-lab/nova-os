# Yearn DAO Outreach - Value-First

**Target:** Yearn governance contributors / core team
**Channels:** Discord (@yearn), Twitter (@iearnfinance)
**Value:** $20-30K contract (vault monitoring + governance automation)

## Message (Discord/Twitter DM)

Hi [Name],

I've been following Yearn's evolution — you're still the yield optimization standard with 100+ vaults across 10+ chains.

**The pain I see:**
Your core contributors are tracking:
- Vault performance vs. competitors (Aave, Compound, Curve)
- Strategy shifts and risk events
- Multi-chain deployment status (L2s, alternatives)
- YFI governance (proposals, voting power)

Easily 15-20 hours/week of manual monitoring across dashboards and spreadsheets.

**I can automate this:**

Build a 4-agent vault + governance suite:
1. **Performance Agent** — Tracks vault APY vs. competitors, alerts on divergence
2. **Risk Agent** — Monitors strategy changes, unusual drawdowns, depeg events
3. **Deployment Agent** — Tracks multi-chain vault rollouts and TVL migration
4. **Governance Agent** — Aggregates proposals, voting power, delegation

**Proof it works:**
I built similar automation for Base Security Council — 12-entity coordination reduced from 8 hours to 2 hours per upgrade.

**Offer:**
30-day free pilot → $3-4K/month retainer if it delivers value.

Setup time: 7-10 days
Tech stack: OpenClaw + Yearn API + competitor APIs + on-chain monitors

Want a quick call to see the mockup?

## Research Notes

**Why Yearn?**
- 100+ vaults across 10+ chains
- High operational complexity (strategy rotation, risk management)
- YFI governance is critical (protocol direction, fees)
- Multi-chain expansion (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, etc.)

**Pain points:**
- Vault performance tracking (vs. competitors is manual)
- Risk monitoring (strategy failures, depeg events)
- Multi-chain deployment coordination
- YFI governance visibility

**Solution:**
4-agent suite:
1. **Performance** — APY tracking vs. competitors, divergence alerts
2. **Risk** — Strategy changes, drawdowns, unusual events
3. **Deployment** — Multi-chain rollout status, TVL flows
4. **Governance** — Proposals, voting, delegation

**ROI:**
- Saves 15-20 hours/week
- Faster risk response (strategy failures, depegs)
- Better competitive intelligence (know when vaults underperform)
- Data-driven governance decisions

**Value:**
- $3-4K/month retainer
- Or $20-30K one-time setup

**Alternatives:**
- Yearn's own dashboards (yearn.vision) — passive, no alerts
- DefiLlama (TVL/APY tracking) — high-level, no vault detail
- Spreadsheets + Discord alerts — manual, error-prone

## Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 1:** "Any thoughts on the vault monitoring + governance automation? Happy to hop on a 15-min call to walk through the mockup."

**Day 3:** "Saw [specific vault] had a [strategy change/performance shift] yesterday — exactly the kind of thing the Performance Agent would catch immediately. Still interested in the pilot?"

**Day 7:** "Yearn's competitive edge is automation — but your core team is still doing manual monitoring. This suite automates the busywork so you can focus on strategy. Week from now still good for a demo?"

**Day 14:** "Closing the loop — if vault automation isn't a priority right now, totally understand. If it becomes one, you know where to find me."
