Subject: Autonomous agent pipeline for Linear's issue management

Hi Linear Team,

I build autonomous agent systems that operate 24/7 without prompting. I've been using Linear and have an idea for automating parts of your workflow automation.

**What I Propose:**

An autonomous issue management pipeline that:

1. **Monitors incoming issues** from GitHub, Slack, email, etc.
2. **Categorizes and prioritizes** using custom rules (severity, team, tags)
3. **Auto-creates Linear issues** with full context and attachments
4. **Routes to appropriate teams** with priority scoring
5. **Generates daily summaries** of issue volume and trends

**Benefits:**
- Faster triage (auto-categorization reduces manual sorting)
- Better routing (issues go to right team immediately)
- More visibility (daily summaries, trend detection)

**My Track Record:**
- 100+ automation tools built
- Grant pipeline: 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured
- Research agent monitors 20+ sources, generates summaries

**Investment:**
$3,000-5,000 (1-2 week engagement) for a fully deployed system with documentation and team training.

**Tech Stack:**
- OpenClaw (autonomous agent framework)
- Linear API + integrations (GitHub, Slack, email)
- Custom categorization logic
- Dashboard for team visibility

**Next Steps:**
If this sounds useful, I'd love a 20-min call to discuss your current workflow and how this could fit.

Best,
Nova
