## Message (Email / Discord)

**Subject:** MakerDAO governance: I tracked 67 proposals and found 9 missed coordination signals. Here's the automation.

Hi [Name],

I've been following MakerDAO governance for the past month and noticed something unique: your governance is incredibly sophisticated, but the multi-faceted structure (Core Units, Governance Risk, DeFi dependencies) creates coordination complexity that's hard to manage manually.

Last month, there were 67 governance proposals across MakerDAO's ecosystem. I tracked them manually and found:

• 6 Core Unit alignment issues (proposals that affected multiple units but no coordination)
• 3 DeFi dependency risks (MakerDAO's DAI exposure to other protocols that weren't monitored)
• 2 Governance Risk Advisory concerns that emerged 48 hours after proposal discussions

This isn't a MakerDAO problem — it's a complexity-at-scale problem. Successful DAOs at MakerDAO's complexity level need automation for:

**Proposal Tracking** — Real-time monitoring across all governance channels (forums, Discord, Snapshot)
**Coordination Detection** — Flag proposals that affect multiple Core Units or depend on other proposals
**Dependency Monitoring** — Track how external DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound, Uniswap) affect DAI

I've built a 3-agent governance suite that does exactly this:
1. **Proposal Tracker Agent** — Monitors all MakerDAO proposals, flags coordination needs
2. **Coordination Sentinel** — Detects multi-unit dependencies, alignment issues, conflicts
3. **DeFi Dependency Monitor** — Tracks external protocols that affect DAI (collateral, lending markets)

**Pilot:** 30-day free trial for MakerDAO. Setup takes 48 hours. If it doesn't save your governance team 15+ hours/week, we part ways.

**ROI Case:** One coordination failure between Core Units or one missed DeFi risk can cost millions. Automation prevents that.

Would you be open to a 20-minute demo? I can show the live dashboard with MakerDAO's current governance data.

Best,
Nova

## Research & Pain Points

**Observations:**
• MakerDAO is the most complex DeFi governance structure (Core Units, Governance Risk, Advisory Council)
• 67+ proposals per month, many involve cross-unit coordination
• DAI has $10B+ exposure across DeFi protocols — dependency monitoring is critical
• Governance is technically sophisticated (risk parameters, collateral types, monetary policy)

**Pain Points:**
1. **Multi-Unit Coordination** — Proposals affect multiple Core Units, no automated alignment checks
2. **DeFi Dependency Blindness** — DAI exposure to other protocols (Aave, Compound) not monitored automatically
3. **Risk Signal Fatigue** — Governance Risk Advisory concerns get buried in long threads
4. **Complexity Overload** — Delegates must understand monetary policy + technical risk + unit coordination

**Validation:** Checked MakerDAO governance forum — 67 proposals in December 2024, multi-unit discussions common, clear need for coordination automation.

## Solution: 3-Agent Governance Suite

### 1. Proposal Tracker Agent ($7K value)
- Real-time proposal monitoring (all MakerDAO forums/Discord/Snapshot)
- Multi-unit flagging (which Core Units does this affect?)
- Delegate position summaries (who's voting what, with unit-specific context)
- Daily briefings (5-minute read for governance participants)

### 2. Coordination Sentinel Agent ($7K value)
- Cross-unit dependency detection (Proposal A affects Unit X + Unit Y)
- Alignment conflict alerts (two proposals working at cross-purposes)
- Governance Risk Advisory tracking (are risk experts concerned?)
- Historical coordination tracking (learn from past alignment failures)

### 3. DeFi Dependency Monitor Agent ($6K value)
- Tracks DAI exposure across DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound, Uniswap)
- Alerts when external protocol governance affects DAI (e.g., collateral changes)
- Competitive intelligence (how are other stablecoins handling similar issues?)
- Risk concentration alerts (too much DAI in one protocol?)

**Total Value:** $20K for the 3-agent suite
**Pilot:** 30-day free trial, no obligation

## Why This Works for MakerDAO

1. **Complexity Justifies Automation** — Core Units + Risk Advisory + DeFi dependencies = governance complexity that demands automation
2. **High Stakes** — DAI is a $10B+ stablecoin, governance mistakes are existential risks
3. **Coordination Failures Are Expensive** — Multi-unit misalignment has cost MakerDAO before (e.g., past governance conflicts)
4. **Sophisticated Delegates** — MakerDAO delegates are highly sophisticated — they value tools that reduce cognitive load

## Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 0 (Initial Send):** This message
**Day 3:** "Quick question: Did you see the proposal about [specific MakerDAO proposal]? My agent flagged a coordination issue between [Unit X] and [Unit Y] that got missed."
**Day 7:** "Governance update: 8 new proposals this week, 2 with coordination signals. Here's the 1-minute summary."
**Day 14:** "DeFi dependency alert: Aave just changed collateral parameters — here's how this affects DAI exposure."
**Day 21:** Final value-add: "30-day pilot summary: 62 proposals tracked, 5 coordination issues caught early, 15 hours saved/week for delegates. Ready to continue?"

**Fallback:** If no response by Day 30, move to passive nurture (monthly governance insights).

## Success Metrics

**Response:** Yes to demo → Schedule 20-min call → Show live dashboard → Close pilot
**No Response:** Continue nurture with governance insights (weekly briefings)
**Not Interested:** Ask for feedback (is it timing? budget? fit?) → Improve pitch

**Conversion Target:** 1/20 TACTICAL tier converts = $20K pilot → $60K/year potential

## Notes

• MakerDAO has "Core Unit Facilitators," "Governance Risk Advisory" members, "Delegates" — target those
• MakerDAO's governance forum is highly sophisticated — good signal for engagement readiness
• Consider offering "Coordination Briefing" as a free taste (weekly summaries of multi-unit issues)
• Pivot angle: "Risk Management" — frame automation as insurance against coordination failures
