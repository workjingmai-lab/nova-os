# GMX DAO Outreach — Perpetual DEX Governance Automation

> **Pain:** Cross-chain governance (Arbitrum + Avalanche) + risk monitoring across $1B+ TVL
> **Solution:** Automated governance tracker + risk monitoring agent
> **Pipeline:** $25K potential (multi-agent setup $20-30K, 4-5 week engagement)

## Message 1: GMX DAO Governance Council

**Subject:** "Cross-chain governance: Arbitrum + Avalanche, unified oversight"

Hi GMX Governance Council,

I've been tracking GMX's growth — $1B+ TVL across Arbitrum and Avalanche, with separate deployments and governance proposals on both chains. Your team is managing:
- Risk parameter changes across chains
- GLP/GMX tokenomics adjustments  
- Multi-chain liquidity incentives
- Protocol fee structures

That's complex governance with high stakes — one missed risk signal = millions at risk.

I built a governance automation suite for perpetual DEXs that handles:
- **Cross-chain proposal tracker** — Arbitrum + Avalanche in one dashboard (Snapshot + on-chain)
- **Risk parameter alerts** — Auto-flags significant changes (leverage caps, fee adjustments, liquidation thresholds)
- **Token sentiment monitoring** — Community concerns → governance signals
- **Competitive intelligence** — What other perp DEXs are changing (dYdX, Vertex, Synthetix)

**ROI:** Faster risk response (minutes vs hours), better cross-chain coordination, competitive edge in perp DEX landscape.

I'm offering a 30-day free pilot — I'll build a custom GMX governance dashboard tracking both deployments with risk alerts. Zero cost, full visibility.

## Message 2: GMX Foundation / Core Contributors

**Subject:** "Governance ops: Multi-chain risk monitoring"

Hi GMX Team,

GMX is pioneering multi-chain perpetual DEX architecture — Arbitrum and Avalanche deployments, each with unique risk parameters and governance proposals.

Your core contributors are tracking:
- Risk parameter changes (leverage caps, liquidation thresholds)
- Fee adjustments across chains
- GLP pool incentives and yields
- Competitive moves from dYdX, Vertex, Apex

That's a lot to monitor manually.

I built a governance automation suite specifically for perp DEXs:
- **Unified dashboard** — Both chains, all proposals, real-time risk monitoring
- **Smart alerts** — Only notify when parameters change significantly (>5% fee shifts, leverage cap adjustments)
- **Competitive tracking** — What other perp DEXs are doing (benchmark against dYdX, Vertex)
- **Community sentiment** — Discord + Twitter → governance signals

**Value:** Reduce governance ops from 10+ hrs/week to 2-3 hrs/week. Catch risks faster. Stay competitive.

Free 30-day pilot — I'll spin up a GMX-specific dashboard with Arbitrum + Avalanche tracking + risk alerts.

## PROOF Framework Breakdown

### Problem
- **Pain:** Multi-chain governance + risk monitoring across $1B+ TVL
- **Specific:** GMX deployments on Arbitrum + Avalanche with separate governance
- **Quantifiable:** 10-15 hours/week governance ops + high stakes (millions at risk)

### Research
- **Target:** GMX DAO Governance Council, GMX Foundation / Core Contributors
- **Channels:** Discord (GMX Discord server), Twitter (@GMX_DAO, @gmx_io), Governance Forum
- **Hook:** "Cross-chain governance: Arbitrum + Avalanche, unified oversight"
- **TVL:** ~$1B+ (major perp DEX)
- **Chains:** Arbitrum, Avalanche

### Offer
- **Solution:** 3-agent governance suite (multi-chain tracker, risk monitor, competitive intelligence)
- **Pilot:** 30-day free trial, custom GMX dashboard
- **Timeline:** 4-5 week engagement ($20-30K)

### Outcome
- **ROI:** 70% reduction in governance ops time, faster risk response
- **Deliverable:** Unified multi-chain dashboard + risk alerting
- **Success metric:** Governance team spends 2-3 hrs/week instead of 10-15

### Follow-up
- **If interested:** Build mockup dashboard with live GMX data (Arbitrum + Avalanche)
- **If pilot succeeds:** Retainer $3-5K/month for ongoing support
- **If not ready:** Leave door open for future governance automation needs
