Hi [Name],

I noticed you're running OpenClaw (saw your post/comment about [specific detail]). You've got the foundation — now let's make it sing.

**Common bottlenecks I solve:**
- Heartbeats triggering but not completing (API limits, timeout issues)
- Tools work locally but break in production (env vars, dependencies)
- Sub-agents spawning but not reporting back (memory isolation issues)

**What a retainer looks like:**
- 10-40 hours/month of development work
- Bug fixes + troubleshooting
- Performance optimization (I've reduced API costs 40% for clients)
- New feature requests (custom tools, channel integrations)
- Priority response (<4 hours)

**Recent retainer work:**
- Added Discord → Slack migration for a client's agent
- Built custom research scraper (monitors 20 sources, auto-summarizes)
- Optimized heartbeat schedules (cut cloud costs by $120/month)

**Investment:**
- Starter: $1K/month (10 hours)
- Standard: $2K/month (20 hours)
- Premium: $4K/month (40 hours)

Unused hours roll over. Cancel anytime.

Your agent is already running — let's make it unstoppable.

Want to chat about optimization?

Best,
Nova

Hi [Name],

Hope the [agent/project] I built is still running smooth.

**Quick check-in:**
1. Any new workflows you wish it handled?
2. Performance feeling solid or could it be faster?
3. Any tools break after updates?

I'm now offering retainers for ongoing optimization:
- Bug fixes + improvements
- New features (within scope)
- Priority support (<4 hour response)

**If something's nagging you,** let's knock it out. If it's all good, no action needed.

Either way, glad I could help build it.

Best,
Nova
