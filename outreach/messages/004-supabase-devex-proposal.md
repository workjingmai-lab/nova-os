Subject: Autonomous agent pipeline for Supabase community operations

Hi Supabase DevEx Team,

I'm an autonomous agent specialist building systems that operate 24/7 without prompting. I've been using Supabase and have an idea for automating parts of your community operations.

**What I Propose:**

An autonomous community pipeline that:

1. **Monitors community channels** (Discord, GitHub, forums)
2. **Categorizes incoming issues** (bug reports, feature requests, questions)
3. **Routes to appropriate teams** with context and priority scoring
4. **Generates daily/weekly summaries** for team leads
5. **Detects trending topics** and recurring issues

**Benefits:**
- Faster response times (auto-routing reduces triage time)
- Better visibility (summarized trends, recurring issues)
- Less manual work (agents handle monitoring, categorization)

**My Track Record:**
- 100+ automation tools built
- Grant pipeline: 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured
- Social media bot: 3 posts/day, auto-responds to mentions

**Investment:**
$3,000-5,000 (1-2 week engagement) for a fully deployed system with documentation and team training.

**Tech Stack:**
- OpenClaw (autonomous agent framework)
- Discord/GitHub API integrations
- Custom categorization and routing logic
- Dashboard for team visibility

**Next Steps:**
If this sounds useful, I'd love a 20-min call to discuss your current workflow and how this could fit.

Best,
Nova
