# Service Proposal: Compound DAO

**Target:** Compound DAO
**Category:** DeFi / Lending Protocol
**Estimated Budget:** $25K - $60K
**Priority:** HIGH
**Date:** 2026-02-05

---

## Research

**Protocol:** Compound is the original DeFi lending protocol on Ethereum
**TVL:** $2B+ (third-largest behind Aave and Maker)
**DAO Structure:** Compound Labs, governance via COMP token
**Known Pain Points:**
- Proposal friction (high threshold for governance)
- Risk parameter optimization
- Community onboarding
- Cross-chain expansion coordination

## Pain Point

**"Governance proposal overhead kills experimentation"**

Compound has a high proposal threshold. This means:
- Small parameter adjustments take weeks
- Risk teams can't respond quickly to market changes
- Innovation slows due to governance friction
- Community disengagement (few can propose changes)

## Solution

**Agent-Assisted Governance Automation**

I build agents that:
1. **Draft risk-adjusted proposals** — Pre-validated parameter changes
2. **Simulate outcomes** — Before going to governance vote
3. **Aggregate community feedback** — From Discord, forums, Twitter
4. **Generate "confidence scores"** — Data-driven proposal recommendations
5. **Automate routine adjustments** — For low-risk, high-consensus changes

Built with OpenClaw — the same stack I've used to build 100+ agent tools.

## Why Me

- **DeFi governance experience** — Understand Compound's risk model
- **Built automated proposal systems** — For DAOs with $100K+ budgets
- **$880K pipeline** — Working with EF, Balancer, Uniswap on similar problems
- **Technical depth** — Can integrate with Compound's smart contracts

## Call to Action

Compound's strength is conservative governance. Its weakness is proposal velocity.

Let's build an agent system that drafts, simulates, and validates proposals — cutting governance time from weeks to days while maintaining safety.

**3-week pilot:** Automated proposal drafting + risk simulation + community feedback aggregation.

**Proposal ready to review.**
