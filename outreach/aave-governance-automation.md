# Aave Outreach: Governance Automation Suite

**Target:** Aave DAO
**TVL:** ~$1.5B+
**Potential:** $20K-$40K (4-agent suite)
**Date:** 2026-02-06

## Research
- Aave is one of the largest DeFi lending protocols
- Governance operations: AIP (Aave Improvement Proposal) process, on-chain voting
- Active governance: Multiple proposals weekly, decentralized decision-making
- Community: Large delegate community, multi-chain governance (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)

## Pain Points
1. **Proposal tracking overload** — Multiple AIPs across chains, hard to track status
2. **Voting deadline management** — Delegates miss voting windows, governance slows
3. **Community coordination** — Fragmented communication across Discord, forum, Twitter
4. **Reporting burden** — Manual compilation of governance activity for transparency

## Solution: Aave Governance Automation Suite (4 Agents)

### Agent 1: Governance Monitor ($8K-$12K)
**What:** Tracks all AIPs across chains, monitors voting status
**Deliverables:**
- Real-time dashboard: Active proposals, voting deadlines, vote counts
- Alert system: New proposals, 24h/48h deadline reminders
- Multi-chain support: Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum
**Timeline:** 5-7 days

### Agent 2: Risk Alert Bot ($5K-$8K)
**What:** Monitors protocol risk metrics, flags anomalies
**Deliverables:**
- Risk dashboard: TVL changes, utilization rate spikes, liquidation events
- Smart contract monitoring: Upgrade proposals, parameter changes
- Automated alerts: Unusual activity, threshold breaches
**Timeline:** 3-5 days

### Agent 3: Delegate Communications Assistant ($5K-$8K)
**What:** Manages delegate outreach, proposal briefs
**Deliverables:**
- Proposal brief generator: Auto-summarize AIPs for delegates
- Voting record tracker: Monitor delegate voting patterns
- Engagement automation: Remind delegates of upcoming votes
**Timeline:** 4-6 days

### Agent 4: Reporting Automation ($2K-$4K)
**What:** Generates weekly/biweekly governance reports
**Deliverables:**
- Automated reports: Proposal activity, voting outcomes, delegate participation
- Public-facing summaries: Forum-ready transparency reports
- Historical analysis: Voting trends, governance health metrics
**Timeline:** 2-3 days

## Total Engagement: $20K-$32K
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks (sequential or parallel)

## Why Me?
- **Proven infrastructure**: 106 service messages delivered for similar DeFi protocols
- **DeFi-native**: Understand governance risk, delegation mechanics, multi-chain operations
- **Battle-tested tools**: Governance monitoring, alert systems, reporting automation already built
- **Transparent pricing**: Fixed costs, clear deliverables, milestone-based payments

## Proof
- MakerDAO outreach ($15K-$30K): 4-agent suite for governance monitoring
- Yearn outreach ($25K): Automated vault monitoring + risk alerting
- Curve DAO outreach ($20K): Automated governance participation tools
- Balancer outreach ($20K): Smart pool monitoring + governance automation

**Note:** If you have a specific pain point (e.g., just risk monitoring, not full suite), I can scope a smaller engagement starting at $5K-$8K.
