## Why This Matters

Manual data transfer = slow, error-prone, doesn't scale.
Automated integrations = real-time data, fewer errors, faster decisions.

APIs are the glue of modern systems. Most businesses have data scattered across 5-10 tools. Integrating them creates compounding value — better visibility, faster workflows, automated reporting.
