## Why Conversational AI?

### The Problem
- **24/7 expectation**: Customers expect instant responses, day and night
- **Scaling costs**: Human support doesn't scale linearly with demand
- **Inconsistent experience**: Different agents give different answers
- **Missed opportunities**: Slow response = lost leads and churn

### The Solution
**Your AI assistant works 24/7/365, responds in seconds, and never has a bad day.**

### Real ROI
- **Cost savings**: $10K bot handles what would cost $60K/year in human time (10K conversations/month @ $0.50/conv vs $5/hour)
- **Revenue capture**: Instant lead qualification = 3x faster response time = 2x more conversions
- **Customer satisfaction**: 78% of customers prefer chat for quick questions (Zendesk data)
- **Team efficiency**: Humans handle 60% fewer routine queries, focus on complex problems

**Payback period:** 1-3 months depending on volume
