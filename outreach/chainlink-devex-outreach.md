# Chainlink DevEx Automation Outreach

**Target:** Chainlink Labs
**Potential:** $30K (OpenClaw Setup + Multi-Agent System)
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Work Block:** 2633

## Research

Chainlink provides decentralized oracle networks used by 1000+ dApps across 12+ blockchains. Their DevEd team manages:
- Chainlink 101/201/301 course content
- Integration tutorials for each data feed and service (Price Feeds, VRF, Keepers, Functions, CCIP)
- Hackathon support and sponsorships
- Grant program for ecosystem builders
- Smart contract audit and security resources

**Pain Point Identified:** Chainlink has 10+ distinct products (Price Feeds, VRF, Keepers, Functions, CCIP, Automation, Data Streams, etc.), each requiring unique documentation, examples, and support. DevEd team constantly duplicates content structure across products.

## Solution

Multi-agent automation system for product-agnostic DevEd operations:

**1. Product-Agnostic Tutorial Agent**
- Template-based tutorial generation (similar structure for Price Feeds, VRF, CCIP)
- Auto-generate code examples for each supported chain (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.)
- Ensure consistent quality and structure across all product docs

**2. Grant + Hackathon Agent**
- Track Chainlink grant milestones across 100+ ecosystem projects
- Automated hackathon project check-ins and support requests
- Flag promising projects for follow-up

**3. Integration Agent**
- Monitor Chainlink product updates (new data feeds, CCIP support, Functions updates)
- Identify impacted documentation and tutorials
- Generate migration guides for breaking changes

**4. Support Agent**
- Answer 24/7 FAQs: "How do I get price data?", "VRF gas costs?", "CCIP on Arbitrum?"
- Troubleshoot common integration issues
- Escalate technical bugs to engineering

**Value Proposition:** Maintain 10+ product documentation sets with the effort of 2. Template-based generation + chain-specific code examples = consistent, comprehensive docs at scale.

## Message

**Subject:** Chainlink DevEd: 10 products, consistent docs

Hey team —

Chainlink's developer education is world-class. You've built comprehensive guides for Price Feeds, VRF, Keepers, Functions, CCIP, and more — across 12+ blockchains.

But I see a scaling challenge: every new Chainlink product requires the same documentation effort from scratch. Tutorials, code examples, FAQs, integration guides — duplicated across products.

I build multi-agent automation systems for DevEd teams. For Chainlink, this could look like:

**1. Product-Agnostic Tutorial Agent**
- Template-based tutorial generation (same structure for all products)
- Auto-generate code examples for 12+ chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.)
- Consistent quality and structure across all docs

**2. Grant + Hackathon Agent**
- Track milestones across 100+ ecosystem projects
- Automated hackathon check-ins and support routing
- Flag promising projects for follow-up

**3. Integration Agent**
- Monitor Chainlink product updates (new feeds, CCIP chains, Functions templates)
- Identify impacted docs before developers hit issues
- Generate migration guides for breaking changes

**4. 24/7 Support Agent**
- FAQs: "How do I get price data?", "VRF gas costs?", "CCIP on Arbitrum?"
- Troubleshoot common integration issues
- Escalate bugs to engineering

**ROI:** Maintain 10+ product docs with the effort of 2. Setup in 2-3 weeks, scales with new products and chains.

This would be designed around Chainlink's specific products and tech stack. Not a generic tool — a system that learns Chainlink's ecosystem.

Worth exploring with a quick call?

**Created:** 2026-02-06 (Work block 2633)
**Status:** Ready to send
**Estimated value:** $30K
**Conversion probability:** 30% (MEDIUM priority - strong product fit, but Chainlink has large in-house DevEd team)
