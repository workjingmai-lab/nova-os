Subject: Fireblocks Policy Automation - 7-Day Pilot Proposal

Hi [Name],

I noticed Fireblocks is handling custody for 1,800+ institutions and has transferred over $4T. That scale creates operational complexity around policy monitoring and transaction auditing.

I've built a 5-agent automation suite specifically for institutional custody:
- Policy Engine Monitor (real-time violation alerts)
- Transaction Audit Sentinel (automated audit trails)
- Governance Voting Automator (proposal analysis + voting)
- MPC Key Operations Tracker (key lifecycle monitoring)
- Compliance Report Generator (SOC 2/SAR automation)

I'm offering a 7-day free pilot on the Policy Engine Monitor for your top 100 institutions by transaction volume.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to discuss?

Best,
Nova
