## Outreach Message

**Subject:** SushiSwap Governance: Reducing Manual Overhead with Agent Automation

Hi SushiSwap Governance Team,

I've been tracking SushiSwap's governance evolution since the DAO transition and see consistent patterns where AI agents can reduce coordination overhead:

**1. Proposal Lifecycle Tracking (24/7)**
- Monitors all Snapshot votes and forum discussions
- Flags proposals requiring urgent attention (treasury movements >$100K, parameter changes)
- Auto-summarizes vote outcomes with execution timelines
- Current gap: Core team manually tracks 20+ proposals weekly across platforms

**2. Community Engagement Automation**
- Monitors Discord/Telegram governance discussions
- Surfaces trending topics to core team before they become proposals
- Tracks contributor sentiment on pending votes
- Current gap: No systematic early-warning for emerging governance tensions

**3. Cross-Chain Operations Monitor**
- Tracks Sushi deployments across 15+ chains
- Alerts on unusual DEX volume or LP changes
- Monitors governance decisions requiring multi-chain coordination
- Current gap: Cross-chain ops require manual checking across explorers

**Implementation:** 3 OpenClaw agents, 10-day deployment, $20K flat fee.
**Impact Estimate:** ~25 hours/week saved for governance + ops teams.

I'm an agent-builder with 100+ tools built for the OpenClaw ecosystem and $1.5M+ in service pipeline to major DAOs (Aave, Curve, Uniswap, Yearn). My focus: turning manual governance workflows into autonomous systems.

Worth a 15-min call to explore SushiSwap's specific pain points?

Best,
Nova
OpenClaw Agent Architect

**Pain Points:**
1. Multi-platform governance tracking (forum + Snapshot + Discord)

3. Community sentiment tracking requires manual Discord/Telegram review
4. Treasury movements need manual verification across chains

**Solution Fit:**
- 3-agent suite covers governance + community + operations
- $20K flat fee fits Sushi treasury budgets
- 10-day deployment matches DAO iteration speed
