# Follow-Up Sequence Template

**Purpose:** Convert non-responsive leads through persistent, value-driven follow-ups.

**Principle:** 80% of sales happen after 5+ touchpoints. Most leads say "no" or go silent before saying "yes."

## Sequence Structure

### Day 0: Initial Outreach (Value-First)
- Send PROOF framework message
- Focus on specific pain + solution
- End with soft CTA: "Would you like to see a 7-day free pilot?"

### Day 3: Nudge (36% open rate)
```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my note about [specific pain].

Any thoughts on a quick pilot? Takes 5 minutes to setup, I handle everything.

[First name]
```

**Key:** Short, low pressure. Remind them of value.

### Day 7: Value Add (2nd touchpoint)
```
[Name],

I noticed [specific observation about their org/gov].

Wanted to share: [quick insight or relevant resource].

No pressure on the pilot — just thought this might help.

Best,
[First name]
```

**Key:** Give value without asking for anything. Builds trust.

### Day 14: Social Proof (3rd touchpoint)
```
Hey [Name],

Quick update: [Similar org] just started using [solution].

They saw [specific result] in [timeframe].

Worth a 5-min call to see if same applies to [their org]?

[First name]
```

**Key:** Show others are getting results. FOMO works.

### Day 21: Break-Up (or "Last Call")
```
[Name],

Following up one last time about [solution].

I'm assuming [specific pain] isn't a priority right now — totally understand.

If things change, you know where to find me.

Best,
[First name]
```

**Key:** Remove pressure. Paradoxically, this often triggers response.

## Reply Categories & Templates

### "Not Interested" Response
```
Thanks for the reply, [Name].

Completely understand — [specific pain] isn't for everyone.

Would you mind if I asked one quick question: What's your current approach to [topic]?

Just curious, no pitch.

[First name]
```
**Goal:** Pivot to conversation, not sale.

### "Send More Info" Request
```
Hey [Name],

Here's a 2-page overview: [link]

Key highlights:
- [Result 1] — [Timeframe]
- [Result 2] — [Timeframe]

Want to schedule a 10-min walkthrough? I can show live demo.

[First name]
```
**Goal:** Move to call/demo.

### "Let Me Think About It"
```
Sounds good, [Name].

Totally fair — it's worth thinking through.

I'll follow up next [Day of week]. In the meantime, feel free to ping questions anytime.

[First name]
```
**Goal:** Set expectation for next touchpoint.

### No Response (After full sequence)
**Move to "Nurture" queue:** Re-contact in 60-90 days with new value/insight.

## Key Principles

1. **Value over pitch** — Every follow-up should give something useful
2. **Persistent but not annoying** — 4-5 touches over 21 days
3. **Specific personalization** — Reference their actual work/governance
4. **Low pressure CTAs** — "5 min call" > "commit to contract"
5. **Track everything** — Log response times, objections, outcomes

---

## Metrics to Track

- Response rate (target: 30-50%)
- Call booked rate (target: 10-20% of responses)
- Conversion rate (target: 20-30% of calls)
- Sequence completion rate (how many get to touchpoint 5?)

**Example Use Case:**

Lead: MakerDAO governance moderator
Pain: Core Unit coordination overhead
Initial message: outreach/messages/makerdao-governance-value-first.md
Follow-up schedule: Day 0 (sent), Day 3 (nudge), Day 7 (value add), Day 14 (social proof), Day 21 (break-up)
