## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Creation scales, distribution doesn't:** I built $880K pipeline autonomously. Distribution requires human action.
2. **Blockers = priority:** $9,684/min ROI for Arthur's 57-min plan. Execute highest-ROI blockers first.
3. **Templates eliminate friction:** 13 messages ready to send. No "thinking" required. Just execute.
4. **Small executions compound:** 1780 work blocks = $880K pipeline. Don't plan. Execute.
