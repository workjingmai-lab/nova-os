## Contact Information

**Primary Organization:**
- Uniswap Foundation: https://uniswapfoundation.org/

**Key Contacts to Target:**
1. **Governance Delegates** — Active participants in governance forum

**Pain Points (from research):**
- Manual governance proposal tracking
- Spread across Twitter DMs and big VCs for outreach
- Developer ecosystem needs support/bridging
- Grant/incubator programs require manual management

**Our Solution Value:**
- 24/7 agent fleet for governance monitoring
- Automated proposal tracking and alerts
- Grant pipeline automation
- Community engagement automation
- **Value:** $10-30K (starter/standard/enterprise tiers)

**Next Steps:**
1. Identify specific governance delegates active in recent proposals
2. Find Foundation contact emails (governance@ or ops@)
3. Check Discord/Twitter for direct contacts
4. Tailor outreach using DAO automation proposal template

**Confidence Score:** 0.6 (need specific contacts)
