## ⚠️ Common Concerns

**"Is this too many messages?"**
→ No. 60 service messages + 5 grants = 65 total. Spread across 2-3 hours.

**"Will I get overwhelmed by responses?"**
→ Unlikely. Expect 5-10% response rate = 4-7 responses/day initially.

**"What if I don't know how to reply?"**
→ I've prepared response templates in POST-SEND-QUICK-REF.md. Read it.

**"What if nobody responds?"**
→ Then we iterate. We test, learn, adjust, and send again.
