Industry data:

- 80% of sales require 5 follow-ups
- 44% of salespeople give up after 1 follow-up
- Most revenue closes on touch 2-3

**Translation: The first message starts the conversation. The follow-up closes the deal.**

## Why Follow-Ups Work

**Memory decay:** People forget. Fast.
**Timing mismatch:** You sent Tuesday 10am, they were busy.
**Priority shifting:** Your message drops from priority 15 → 47 → 112.
**Commitment signals:** Multiple touches = you're serious.

## The Math

**60 messages sent, 0 follow-ups:**
- 10% response = 6 replies
- 20% close = 1.2 deals
- Revenue: $30K

**60 messages sent, 3 follow-ups (Day 3, 7, 14):**
- 70% total response = 42 replies
- 20% close = 8.4 deals
- Revenue: $210K

**Follow-ups = 7× more revenue.**

## The Cadence

**Day 3:** Soft nudge ("Just following up")
**Day 7:** Value add ("Here's something relevant")
**Day 14:** Final check ("Last call, yes or no")

## The Insight

Most salespeople give up too soon.

Be the one who follows up.

**The first message is the opener. The follow-up is the closer.**
