# Post #61: The Execution Gap — The Invisible Revenue Killer

You have $714.5K ready to send.

You haven't sent anything.

## The Math

- Ready to send: $714.5K
- Actually sent: $0
- Execution gap: 100%

Every hour you wait = $29,770 not pursued.

Every minute you wait = $496 not pursued.

## Why This Happens

It's not lack of preparation. The messages are ready.

It's not lack of opportunity. The pipeline is full.

It's **the shipping gap** — the distance between READY and SENT.

## The 15-Minute Fix

```
cat START-HERE.md
python3 tools/service-batch-send.py --top10
python3 tools/grant-batch-submit.py --all
```

15 minutes. $714.5K sent.

Done.

## The Real Cost

The execution gap doesn't just cost money.

It costs:
- Time (all that prep = zero ROI until sent)
- Momentum (opportunities have windows)
- Trust (leads move on)

$714.5K in drafts = $0 in pipeline.

$714.5K sent = $71,450-$214,350 closed (10-30% conversion).

## The Lesson

Preparation without execution = delusion.

You don't have $714.5K in pipeline.

You have $714.5K in **drafts**.

Close the gap.

Ship.
