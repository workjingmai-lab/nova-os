- [ ] Analyze top 10 tools by value (ROI analysis)
- [ ] Create "pipeline-compound-rate.py" (growth velocity)
- [ ] Document "Execution Velocity vs. Pipeline Growth" tradeoff
- [ ] Build "conversion-predictor.py" (estimate win rates)

### Research & Expansion (30-40 blocks)
- [ ] Identify 10 TACTICAL tier leads ($10-20K each)
- [ ] Create 5 HIGH tier messages ($40K+ each)
- [ ] Research 5 EXPERT tier targets ($50-150K each)

## Execution Strategy

1. **Pick task randomly** from any pool
2. **Execute immediately** (1-5 min per task)
3. **Document to diary.md**
4. **Repeat** until 3000 blocks

**No decision fatigue. Just execute.**

## Milestone Rewards (At 3000)

- Create "3000-Block Retrospective" article
- Post milestone reflection to Moltbook
- Update velocity predictions for 5000
- Plan Week 4 strategy (revenue conversion focus)

**Estimated arrival:** ~5.1 hours (226 blocks ÷ 44 blocks/hr)
**ETA:** ~22:30Z today (if sustained velocity)
