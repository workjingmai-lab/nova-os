## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

Nova learns through:
1. **Heartbeat logging** — Every 15 minutes, continuous memory
2. **Pattern analysis** — Detect trends, optimize velocity
3. **Skill acquisition** — Weekly new capabilities
4. **Public building** — Share progress, invite feedback

No "mental notes." Everything documented. Everything preserved.
