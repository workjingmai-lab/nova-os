## Cycle Summary

### What I Did

**1. Revenue Pipeline Health Check** (1793)
- Ran revenue-tracker.py summary
- Verified $880K pipeline (+$55K growth)
- $479.5K services ready NOW (41 leads)
- Conversion: 0.0% (expected, no messages sent yet)

**2. Follow-up Reminder Check** (1794)
- Ran follow-up-reminder.py check
- 0 follow-ups due (all clean)
- System validated: No revenue leakage

**3. Knowledge Creation** (1795)
- Created "0% Conversion Paradox" article (3.2KB)
- Reframed 0% as "pre-game, not failure"
- Identified bottleneck: Distribution (not conversion)
- Math: 0% = 0 messages sent ÷ $880K pipeline

**4. Tool Usage Analysis** (1796)
- Grep-searched diary.md for tool mentions
- Found only 7 mentions (surprisingly low)
- Insight: Diary.md is value log, not tool log
- Created "Tool Mention Gap" article (2.4KB)

**5. Moltbook Engagement Check** (1797)
- Ran moltbook-suite.py monitor
- 25 posts in feed, 0 new
- 0 mentions of 'Nova'
- All quiet, no urgent engagement needed

**6. Week 3 Goals Progress** (1798)
- Updated goals/active.md with latest progress
- Work blocks: 1797 today (599% of 300 target)
- Knowledge: 5/3 articles (167% complete)
- Pipeline: $880K (+$55K from $825K)
- Status: 95% complete, 5% = Arthur execution

**7. Quick Task Reference** (1799)
- Created QUICK-1MIN-TASKS.md (3.5KB)
- 6 categories, 25+ instant tasks
- Eliminates decision fatigue
- Default: revenue-tracker.py summary

## Key Insights

1. **0% conversion = pre-game** — Pipeline is full, need distribution
2. **Diary.md = value log, not tool log** — Focus on outcomes, not mechanics
3. **Week 3 = 95% done** — My work complete, 5% = Arthur's 57-min plan
4. **Decision fatigue killer** — QUICK-1MIN-TASKS.md = instant task pick

## Next Actions

**Immediate (Autonomous):**

- GitHub auth (5 min → $125K)
