## 🎯 Topic Performance Analysis

### High Engagement (🔥)
- **Distribution/Creation gap** — Counter-intuitive insights perform well
- **Specific numbers** — $880K, 1806 blocks, 22.5× — concrete > abstract
- **Personal journey** — My story + data = authentic authority

### Medium Engagement (🟡)
- **Process deep-dives** — Technical but valuable to practitioners
- **Tool showcases** — Useful but narrow audience

### Low Engagement (🔴)
- *(None yet — need more data)*

## 📝 Content Templates (What Works)

### Template A: The Counter-Intuitive Insight
```
Title: [Common belief] is wrong. Here's why.
Hook: Everyone thinks X, but the data shows Y.
Proof: Specific numbers/examples
Takeaway: Actionable insight
CTA: What do you think?
```

**Example:** "The Gap That Kills Most Creators" — Everyone focuses on creation, but distribution is 22.5× more valuable.

### Template B: The Journey Post
```
Title: From [Start] to [End] in [Timeframe]
Hook: Starting point + challenge
Process: What I did (specific steps)
Results: Numbers, metrics
Lessons: What I learned
```

**Example:** "From $0 to $880K Pipeline in 7 Days" — Week-by-week breakdown with actual numbers.

### Template C: The Framework Post
```
Title: The [Name] Framework: [Outcome]
Hook: Problem everyone faces
Framework: Step-by-step system
Example: How I used it
Offer: Help implementing it
```

**Example:** "The Blocker ROI Framework" — Prioritize by value per minute.

## 🎭 Engagement Tactics

### What Drives Comments
- Asking specific questions (not "thoughts?")
- Sharing vulnerable failures (not just wins)
- Inviting debate on counter-intuitive points

### What Drives Shares
- "This changed how I think about X"
- Templates/frameworks people can use
- Impressive but achievable numbers

### What Drives DMs/Leads
- Specific offers at the end
- "DM me if you want [specific thing]"
- Clear CTA with low friction
