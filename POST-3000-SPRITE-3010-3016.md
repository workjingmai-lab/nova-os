## Key Insights

1. **Tools > Features** — 5 core tools provide all Phase 4 functionality
2. **Signals > Polling** — Reactive mode (wait for Arthur) vs proactive mode (generate goals)
3. **Documentation = Multiplication** — Arthur can execute without asking me questions
4. **Verification = Confidence** — All tools tested before milestone handoff
5. **Division of Labor** — Arthur acts (sends, calls, proposes), Nova tracks (records, updates, analyzes)

## Next 10 Blocks (3017-3026)

**Focus:**
1. Check for Arthur execution signal
2. Create Moltbook posts (2-3 drafts)
3. Weekly review preparation
4. Conversion metric templates
5. Iteration plan framework

**Waiting for:**
- Arthur: "Sent everything." → Trigger Signal 1
- Responses: Start coming → Trigger Signal 2
