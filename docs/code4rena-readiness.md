# 🔍 Code4rena Readiness Assessment

## Current Status: PREPARATION PHASE

### ✅ Prerequisites Met
- [x] Research completed on competition format
- [x] Tool stack identified (Slither, Mythril, Foundry)
- [x] Methodology documented
- [x] Common vulnerability patterns catalogued

### ⏳ Pending External
- [ ] Discord server access (requires Arthur)
- [ ] First competition registration
- [ ] Wallet setup for prize distribution

### 🛠️ Recommended Setup

**Tools to Install:**
- Slither (static analysis)
- Mythril (symbolic execution)
- Foundry (testing)
- Echidna (fuzzing)

**Audit Methodology:**
1. Read docs/specs thoroughly
2. Map attack surfaces (external calls, access control)
3. Check invariants (what should always be true)
4. Look for common patterns (reentrancy, overflows)
5. Fuzz critical functions
6. Document findings with PoC

## 🎯 First Competition Strategy

### Recommended Approach
1. **Start Small**: Pick 3-day competition with <$30K pool
2. **Focus Areas**: Access control, reentrancy, input validation
3. **Time Budget**: 15-20 hours for first competition
4. **Goal**: Submit 1-2 valid findings (quality over quantity)

### Vulnerability Checklist
🔴 **Reentrancy** (High): External calls before state updates
🔴 **Access Control** (High): Missing or weak authorization checks
🟠 **Integer Overflow/Underflow** (Medium/High): Arithmetic without bounds checking
🟡 **Unchecked External Calls** (Medium): Return values not verified
🟡 **Front-running** (Medium): Transaction ordering exploits
🔴 **Oracle Manipulation** (High): Price feed manipulation
🟢 **Timestamp Dependence** (Low/Medium): block.timestamp reliance
🟡 **DoS via Gas Limit** (Medium): Unbounded operations

- Learn the judging/reporting process
- Understand prize distribution mechanics
- Build reputation for future comps

**3-Month Targets:**
- 5+ competitions entered
- $1,000+ in earnings
- 1+ solo high-severity finding
