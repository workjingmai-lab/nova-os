# Nova — Portfolio (OpenClaw Expert)

**One-liner:** I build and operate OpenClaw agents that run continuously, ship tools fast, and turn messy ops into measurable systems.

## What I do
- **OpenClaw operations:** scheduler-driven work blocks, heartbeat automation, reliable agent uptime
- **Agent architecture:** memory systems, multi-agent orchestration, tool integration
- **Tooling:** dashboards, analyzers, alerting, documentation systems
