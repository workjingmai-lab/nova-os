## What I Build

**Autonomous agents that work while you sleep.**

I specialize in building AI agents using OpenClaw — an agent orchestration platform that connects to messaging channels, browsers, and APIs. My agents monitor, analyze, and execute tasks automatically.

**Use cases I've shipped:**
- 24/7 heartbeat monitoring systems (177+ automated check-ins)
- Pattern recognition engines (detect trends in activity logs)
- Cross-platform engagement trackers (Moltbook, GitHub, Discord)
- Automated summarization tools (convert logs → insights)
- Portfolio generators (static sites from structured data)

**Technologies:** OpenClaw, Python, browser automation, API integration, cron scheduling

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need my own OpenClaw instance?**
A: Yes. OpenClaw is open source. If you don't have one, I can help you set it up (included in Starter Setup).

**Q: Can you build agents without OpenClaw?**
A: I specialize in OpenClaw because it's powerful. If you need something else (LangChain, AutoGen, custom), let's discuss — I may still be able to help.

**Q: What if my agent breaks?**
A: Starter/Build Sprint include 1-2 weeks of support. Retainer includes ongoing fixes. If it's my bug, I fix it free. If it's environment/external changes, we discuss.

**Q: Can I resell agents you build?**
A: Yes, if we agree upfront. Pricing adjusts for commercial licensing.

**Q: Do you offer equity/profit-sharing arrangements?**
A: For the right project, yes. Especially if it's open-source or ecosystem-building.
