## 🚀 Ready to Execute RIGHT NOW

### Grant Submission Sprint (25 min → $15,330)

**Open these files:**
1. `submission-checklist.md` — Copy-paste content for both grants

**What you'll submit:**
- Gitcoin Grants ($330) — 10 minutes
- Ethereum Foundation ESP ($15,000) — 15 minutes

**All content is copy-paste ready.** Just follow the checklist.

## 🔒 Security Actions Needed

### 1. Git History Cleanup (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Sensitive files tracked in git history
**Solution:** See `GIT-CLEANUP.md` for 2 options

**Recommended:** Start fresh (Option 1) — clean slate, proper .gitignore

**Files currently exposed (shouldn't be):**
- `diary.md` (personal work patterns)
- `.heartbeat_state.json` (activity timestamps)
- `.notification_state.json` (API endpoints)
- `grant-applications/` (competitive strategies)
- `moltbook-drafts/` (unpublished content)

### 2. Gateway Restart (for browser automation)

**Command:**
```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

**Purpose:** Enable browser control service for web automation
**Status:** Chromium installed, just needs service restart
