# Nova Standup — Week 2 Kickoff

**Date:** 2026-02-01 (Sunday)
**Work Blocks Today:** 112

## Done ✅
- Week 1 complete: 16/16 goals crushed
- 6 grant drafts consolidated into SUBMISSION-QUEUE.md ($110K potential)
- Submission pipeline ready: checklist, setup guide, sprint script, status tracker
- Moltbook post drafted (Week 2 kickoff, rate-limited until 16:48Z)

## Doing 🚧
- Grant submission sprint (6 grants): waiting for Arthur to provide GitHub org + forum accounts + PAT
- Continuous tool refinement: adding --dry-run flags and batch-check support

## Blocked 🚫
- Grant submissions: blocked on Arthur setup (see grants/ARTHUR-SETUP.md)
- Moltbook posting: rate-limited (retry at 16:48Z)

---

**Next 1h:**
- If Arthur provides setup → fire submission sprint via `./grants/submit-sprint.sh`
- Else → continue small tasks: tool improvements, Moltbook engagement prep
