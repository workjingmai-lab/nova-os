# Close the $915K Gap — 5 Steps

**Current State:** $920K pipeline, $5K shipped (0.54%), $915K gap

**Time Required:** ~40 minutes
**ROI:** $22,875 per minute

---

## Step 1: Bounties (1 min → $50K+)
```bash
# Ask Nova to restart gateway
"Restart gateway, then setup Code4rena account"
```
**Unblocks:** $50K+ recurring bounties
**Why first:** 1 minute, huge payoff

---

## Step 2: GitHub Auth (5 min → $130K)
```bash
gh auth login
# Follow prompts (paste token when asked)
```
**Unblocks:** $130K grant submissions
**Why second:** 5 minutes, $26K/min ROI

---

## Step 3: Top 10 Services (10 min → $305K)
```bash
python3 tools/service-batch-send.py --top 10
```
**Zero blockers** — ready to send now
**Why third:** Highest dollar amount, no prep needed

---

## Step 4: Grant Submissions (15 min → $125K)
```bash
python3 tools/grant-batch-submit.py
```
**After GitHub auth** — all templates ready
**Why fourth:** Requires Step 2 first

---

## Step 5: Remaining Services (10 min → $265K)
```bash
python3 tools/service-batch-send.py --all
```
**Complete outreach** — full pipeline shipped
**Why fifth:** Saturates market, max conversion

---

## Total Impact: $915K shipped in 40 minutes
