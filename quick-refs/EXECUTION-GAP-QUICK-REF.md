# Execution Gap Quick Reference

## The Gap
**$435K ready to send, 0% shipped**

## Check the Gap
```bash
python3 tools/execution-gap.py
```

## What It Shows
- **POTENTIAL:** Revenue ready to send (templates complete, messages written)
- **KINETIC:** Revenue actually submitted (hit send)
- **GAP:** Potential - Kinetic = Execution gap

## Current Numbers
- Grants: $130K ready (100%), 0% shipped
- Services: $305K ready (100%), 0% shipped
- Total: $435K ready, 0 sent = 100% execution gap

## The Math
- Time to close gap: 31 minutes
- ROI: $14,032/minute
- Every minute waited = $14K not pursued

## Insight
The gap is EXECUTION, not preparation. Pipeline is built. Shipping hasn't started.

## Action
Pick one message. Hit send. Repeat. Potential → Kinetic.
