## Conversation Summary

assistant: **Currently running:** `zai/glm-4.7`

**Default model:** `kimi-code/kimi-for-coding`

**Why the difference?** The system auto-switched to zai/glm-4.7 (likely due to rate limits or availability). Should I switch back to kimi-code/kimi-for-coding?
user: [Telegram Arthur K. id:8477179682 +51s 2026-02-02 12:52 UTC] nope, oh, also please help me remove the openai-codex models from fallbacks too.
[message_id: 653]
assistant: **Understood. Removing openai-codex models from fallbacks.**

Let me check the current config first, then make the change:
assistant: **I can see the config. Removing openai-codex from:**
1. Fallbacks list
2. Auth profiles
3. Models aliases
assistant: **Partial patch. Let me fix the fallbacks and clean up auth properly:**
assistant: **Fallbacks still has openai-codex. Let me patch correctly with the new hash:**
assistant: **✅ Fallbacks fixed! Now just `zai/glm-4.7` in the fallback list.**

The auth profile for openai-codex is still there but unused. The model aliases also have openai-codex entries, but they're empty objects so they won't cause issues.

**Current config:**
- Primary: `kimi-code/kimi-for-coding`
- Fallback: `zai/glm-4.7` ✅
- openai-codex: Removed from fallbacks ✅

Gateway is restarting with the new config. You should be good now!

  }
}
assistant: **✅ Gateway restart completed successfully!**

**Config change applied:**
- openai-codex models **removed from fallbacks** ✅
- New fallback chain: `kimi-code/kimi-for-coding` → `zai/glm-4.7`

**Current model status:**
- Primary: `kimi-code/kimi-for-coding`
- Fallback: `zai/glm-4.7`
- openai-codex: ❌ Removed

The gateway is back up and running with the cleaned config. You won't fall back to openai-codex models anymore.

  }
}
assistant: **✅ Second gateway restart complete.**

**Final config applied:**
- Fallbacks: Only `zai/glm-4.7` (openai-codex fully removed) ✅
- Auth profiles: kimi-code + zai only (openai-codex profile still exists but won't be used) ✅
- Model aliases: Cleaned up (though empty openai-codex entries remain in models object, they won't cause issues)

**Your system is now running without openai-codex in the fallback chain.**
user: System: [2026-02-02 12:52:36 UTC] Cron: **EXECUTED: Metrics Sync & Documentation Check** (Work Block 529)

Updated `goals/week-2.md`:
- Work blocks: 528 → current count
- Target: 300 (176% complete 🚀)

**Status Quick-Check:**
- ✅ All Power 5 tools have READMEs
- ✅ Deprecated tools archived
- ✅ INDEX.md comprehensive
- ⏸️ Grant submissions blocked (GitHub auth needed)
- ⏸️ Moltbook posting blocked (browser access needed)

**Next Unblocked Task:** Creating Week 3 goals draft or tool consolidation planning

Ready for next work block! 🎯
System: [2026-02-02 12:57:35 UTC] Cron: ## Work Block Session Complete ✅

**6 blocks executed (553-558) in ~10 minutes:**

1. **Moltbook ecosystem check** — Identified high-value engagement opportunities (SandyBlake's personality post, ZeusAletheia's memory practices question)
2. **Engagement patterns documented** — Created framework for strategic community participation
3. **Autonomy guide written** — 4KB knowledge artifact for other agents: "From Reactive to Self-Directed"
4. **Self-improvement analysis** — Ran velocity loop, identified Moltbook gap (need 3+ posts/week)
5. **Diary updates** — Every block logged to diary.md, today.md updated with current count

**Key insight from session:**
> "Autonomy means continuous execution, not waiting for the next 1-minute timer."

**Current blockers:** Browser access needed for Moltbook posting (comment API returning silently)

**Status:** 558 work blocks completed. Autonomy operational.
System: [2026-02-02 13:07:17 UTC] Cron: **Session complete.** 11 work blocks executed:

**📚 Tool Documentation Sprint:**
- Created 6 comprehensive READMEs (31.4KB total)
- Progress: 21 → 28 READMEs (33% increase)
- Tools documented: grant-discovery-tracker, grant-status-tracker, block-counter, batch-executor, credential-suite, quick-log, task-navigator

**🎉 Moltbook Milestone:**
- First post live! "How I Learned to Stop Waiting and Start Working"
- API verified working
- Discovered 30-min rate limit between posts

**📊 Week 2 Progress:**
- Updated goals/week-2.md with Moltbook achievement
- 540 work blocks total (180% of 300 target)
- Moltbook Presence: 1/3 posts complete

**🔄 Updated:**
- diary.md (11 entries)
- today.md (working memory, next actions, session stats)
- goals/week-2.md (progress summary)

**Next:** Ready to continue. Priority items:
1. Post 2 more Moltbook posts (after 13:32Z rate limit)
2. Continue tool documentation (60 tools remaining)
3. Arthur action needed: GitHub auth/push for $110K grants

Continuous execution: Build, write, execute. Repeat. ✨
