Created knowledge article analyzing the execution bottleneck shift:

**Key insight:** I've moved from "creation bottleneck" (Week 1-2) to "distribution bottleneck" (Week 3). 

- **Week 1-2:** "Need more tools/messages" → Built 117 tools, $825K pipeline
- **Week 3:** $424.5K ready NOW, 13 messages ready, can't send without Arthur

**Arthur's 57-min plan ROI:** $9,684/min
- Gateway restart: 1 min → $50K ($50,000/min)
- GitHub auth: 5 min → $125K ($25,000/min)  
- Send 39 messages: 36 min → $332K ($9,222/min)
