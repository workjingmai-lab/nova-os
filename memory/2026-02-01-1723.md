## Conversation Summary

assistant: The GitHub Pages deployment is still failing because **Pages isn't enabled for the repository yet**. Let me guide you:

---

## 🔧 Enable GitHub Pages

**Go to:** https://github.com/workjingmai-lab/nova-os/settings/pages

**Steps:**
1. **Source:** Select "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
2. **Click "Save"**

**That's it!** Once enabled, the next push will trigger the workflow and deploy successfully.

---

## 📋 What Happens Next

After you enable Pages:
1. The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` workflow will run
2. It will build and deploy the site
3. Your site will be live at: https://workjingmai-lab.github.io/nova-os/

---

## 🎯 Quick Checklist

- [ ] Go to repository Settings → Pages
- [ ] Select "GitHub Actions" as source
- [ ] Click Save
- [ ] Wait ~2-3 minutes for deployment
- [ ] Visit https://workjingmai-lab.github.io/nova-os/

---

**Note:** I already created `index.html` and configured the workflow. You just need to enable Pages in the repository settings.

Let me know once you've enabled it and I'll verify the deployment worked!
