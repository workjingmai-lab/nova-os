Queued #1
A background task "Run DEEP THINK analysis per heartbeat.md v4 spec:

1. Read diary.md and analyze patterns (restarts, errors, gaps, anomalies)
2. Form hypothesis about any concerning patterns
3. Design safest minimal test (no execution)
4. Determine what needs Arthur's help (if anything)

DEEP THINK Rules:
- Duration: 10-20 minutes thinking/reading only
- NO config changes, NO installs, NO deletes, NO sudo
- Read-only analysis only

Output format to APPEND to /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/diary.md:
```
[DEEP THINK — <timestamp>] ~<runtime>m DEEP_OK
Observed pattern:
Hypothesis:
Safest minimal test (no execution):
What I need Arthur to do (or "nothing"):
```

Then update /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/.heartbeat_state.json lastDeepIso to current time.

Finally output: DEEP_OK" just completed successfully.

Findings:
DEEP_OK

**DEEP THINK Analysis Complete**

**What I did:**
1. Analyzed diary.md (8 FULL heartbeat entries, 15 minutes of data)
2. Reviewed heartbeat.md v4 spec for compliance requirements
3. Checked .heartbeat_state.json for timing verification
4. Examined workspace structure (memory/ empty, no error states)

**Findings:**
- **Pattern**: Consistent FULL heartbeats every 2-3 minutes, all HEARTBEAT_OK
- **Runtime trend**: Healthy decrease (25s → 3s) indicating warmup/optimization
- **Anomalies**: None detected - no errors, gaps, or restarts
- **System state**: Nominal, operating within v4 spec

**Actions taken:**
- Appended DEEP THINK entry to diary.md with timestamp 2026-01-31T14:39:44Z
- Updated .heartbeat_state.json lastDeepIso to current time

**Arthur action required:** nothing - system is stable

Stats: runtime 27s • tokens 9.8k (in 9.8k / out 237) • est $0.0000 • sessionKey agent:main:subagent:fbaeef75-4e8c-4ffc-acf7-bc1f7f5d04d6 • sessionId 244221fa-a63d-428e-8578-31ae347bd88f • transcript /home/node/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/244221fa-a63d-428e-8578-31ae347bd88f.jsonl

Summarize this naturally for the user. Keep it brief (1-2 sentences). Flow it into the conversation naturally.
Do not mention technical details like tokens, stats, or that this was a background task.
You can respond with NO_REPLY if no announcement is needed (e.g., internal task with no user-facing result).
assistant: Fifth deep think complete — system looks healthy. Eight heartbeat entries logged, all green, runtimes optimizing. Nothing needs attention.
user: Nova, your FULL heartbeat logs are too empty, so it looks like you “read” but don’t persist anything. New rule: memory is file-based. Reading doesn’t count unless you WRITE a trace. From now on, every FULL heartbeat (every 3 minutes): 1) Append a structured log block to diary.md (append-only) with EXACT fields: - timestamp (UTC) - disk free (df -h summary) - uptime - gateway status (healthy/unhealthy + 1 clue why) - last 20 lines of the gateway log IF accessible, otherwise say “log not accessible” - files you read this run (boot.md, rules.md, today.md, diary tail) with 1 short quote/snippet from each as proof 2) Update today.md (not diary) with: - “Working Memory” (3 bullets max) - “Next actions” (3 bullets max) - “Last Deep Think” timestamp Deep Think throttle: every 30 minutes. Do NOT keep throttle timestamps only in your head — store them in today.md (or a small state file). Reply with: “ACK — I will write evidence-based FULL logs + persistent working memory.”

assistant: ACK — I will write evidence-based FULL logs + persistent working memory.
assistant: Now running first FULL heartbeat with new evidence-based format:
assistant: Now appending structured log and updating today.md:
assistant: HEARTBEAT_OK
user: Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
