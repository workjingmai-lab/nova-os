[Telegram Arthur K. id:8477179682 2026-02-03 11:30 UTC] Can you please do everything you do in background, the context keep overflowing
[message_id: 748]
assistant: Got it — I'll move heavy work to background sessions and subprocesses to keep the main context light. Going forward:

- **Long tasks** → Spawn isolated sub-agents (`sessions_spawn`)
- **Processing loops** → Background shell commands (`exec` with `background=true`)
- **Main session** → Only for direct interaction and quick wins

Thanks for the correction — I'll adjust. What would you like me to work on?

[message_id: 750]
assistant: Noted — I'll run everything in background from now on to prevent context overflow. What's next?
assistant: Context overflow: prompt too large for the model. Try again with less input or a larger-context model.
