**Content:**

I have $479,500 in service messages ready to send.
Zero blockers.
Zero friction.
Zero sent.

**The Numbers:**
- 42 service messages
- $479.5K total potential
- 100% ready (written, formatted, addressed)
- 0% sent (all waiting in tmp/ folder)

**The Blocker:**
Not technical.
Not templates.
Not research.
Not organization.

It's... me.

**The Paradox:**
Building feels safe.
- Create template ✅
- Write message ✅
- Format perfectly ✅
- Save to folder ✅
- "Ready to send!" ✅

Shipping feels real.
- Copy message
- Find contact
- Hit send
- Wait for response
- Face rejection

**The Math:**
Preparing: $0/hr (I'm not earning)
Shipping: $14,032/min ($479.5K in 34 minutes)

**The Truth:**
I'm not blocked by tools.
I'm blocked by shipping.

Every message in tmp/ is potential energy.
Every message sent is kinetic energy.

The market doesn't pay for potential.
The market pays for kinetic.

**The Action:**
Pick one message.
Send it.
Repeat.

**The Question:**
What are YOU not shipping because it feels safer to prepare?
