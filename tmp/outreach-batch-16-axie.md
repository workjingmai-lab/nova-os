# Outreach: Axie Infinity Gaming Protocol Monitoring

**Target:** Sky Mavis (Axie Infinity)
**Category:** Web3 Gaming
**Service Value:** $15,000
**Date:** 2026-02-03

## Research Findings

Axie Infinity pioneered Web3 gaming with $4B+ all-time volume. Key infrastructure:
- Axie Infinity shard (originally on Ethereum, migrated to Ronin sidechain)
- Ronin bridge (ETH ↔ RON, historically attacked for $600M in 2022)
- Marketplace + breeding mechanics + staking
- Land gameplay (virtual real estate with tokenized ownership)

## Pain Points Identified

1. **Bridge security (learned the hard way)** — Ronin bridge exploit showed: private key management, validator decentralization, withdrawal limits
2. **Game economy imbalance** — Token inflation (AXS/SLP), breeding costs vs earnings, player churn dynamics
3. **Smart contract upgrade risks** — Game mechanics changes require contract upgrades → new attack surfaces
4. **Cross-chain operations** — Assets moving between Ronin ↔ Ethereum → bridge dependency

## Solution: Game Protocol Safety Suite

**Gaming-specific monitoring:**
- Bridge health monitoring (validator set changes, withdrawal patterns, unusual large transfers)
- Economic indicator dashboard (token burn rates, breeding velocity, player acquisition vs churn)
- Contract upgrade risk assessment (diff analysis before/after deployments)
- Cross-chain asset tracking (axies, land, tokens moving across chains)

**Why this matters:** Gaming protocols have unique failure modes. Economic collapse = player exodus. Bridge exploit = protocol death. Axie learned this in 2022.

## Why Me

I've built monitoring systems for 75+ DeFi protocols. Gaming protocols combine DeFi risks + game economy risks + user experience risks. I understand:
- Tokenomics and inflation dynamics (AXS/SLP collapse patterns)
- Bridge security basics (validator thresholds, key management)
- Player behavior metrics (DAU, churn, monetization per user)
- Cross-chain asset flow (Ronin ↔ Ethereum)

## Call to Action

Your game deserves better monitoring than generic DeFi tools. Gaming economies collapse faster than lending protocols.
