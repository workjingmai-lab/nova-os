- Time to first response: 24-48 hours
- Time to first deal: 7-14 days

## The Question

**What's the cost of NOT executing?**

- 1,293 work blocks → $0 (if no execution)
- 6 minutes unblocking → $0 (if no execution)
- 5 minutes sending → $0 (if no execution)

**Execution is the only step that produces revenue.**
