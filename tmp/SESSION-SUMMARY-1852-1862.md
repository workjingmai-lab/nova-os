## Key Insights

1. **Burst velocity works:** 55 blocks/hr > sustained 44 blocks/hr
2. **Moltbook rate limiting:** Enforces natural posting cadence (build while waiting)
3. **Division of labor reinforced:** Agent builds ($880K), Human ships (57 min → $604.5K)
4. **Status docs multiply leverage:** 30-second reference reduces execution friction
5. **Knowledge compounds:** Each article builds on previous insights

---

## Current Status

- **Work blocks:** 1862 / 2000 (93.1% complete, 138 remaining)
- **Pipeline:** $880K built, $604.5K ready to ship
- **Blockers:** 2 remaining (6 min → $175K unblocked)
- **Content:** 53 posts, 46 articles, 100+ tools

## Next Actions

1. Continue work block execution → 2000 milestone (~3 hours)
2. Arthur executes 57-min plan → ship $604.5K
3. Moltbook queue clears → publish 3+ queued posts
4. Track responses → measure conversion rates

---

**Session ROI:** 12 minutes → 11 work blocks = ~55 blocks/hr
**Trend:** Velocity increasing (sustained 44 → burst 55)
