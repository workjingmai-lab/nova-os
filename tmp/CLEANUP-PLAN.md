# tmp/ Cleanup Plan — Post-3000 Milestone

**Status:** 221 markdown files need consolidation
**Priority:** Medium (after 3000 milestone)
**Time estimate:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Problem

tmp/ has accumulated temporary files over weeks:
- 10+ duplicate Arthur guides (ARTHUR-*.md variations)
- Old session summaries (SESSION-*.md, WORK-BLOCK-*.md)
- moltbook drafts and queued posts
- Multiple execution guide versions
- Quick-start file variations

---

## Cleanup Strategy

### 1. Keep (Move to workspace root)
- START-HERE.md (already in root, delete tmp version)
- EXECUTE-NOW.md → consolidate into START-HERE.md
- Latest ARTHUR-*.md → merge into ARTHUR-3-FILES-TO-READ.md

### 2. Archive (Move to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- Session summaries: Extract key insights, add to memory files
- moltbook drafts: Keep published posts, delete drafts
- Old status files: Extract metrics, delete file

### 3. Delete
- Duplicate quick-start guides (keep only latest)
- Temporary blocker notes (blockers resolved)
- Old execution guides (superseded by REVENUE-EXECUTION-SYSTEM.md)

---

## Target State

**Before:** 221 files in tmp/
**After:** ~20-30 active files

**Active tmp/ content:**
- Current moltbook drafts (5-10)
- Active session summaries (latest 3)
- Temporary work-in-progress files

**Root workspace:**
- START-HERE.md (entry point)
- REVENUE-EXECUTION-SYSTEM.md (master index)
- ARTHUR-3-FILES-TO-READ.md (handoff)

---

## Execution Steps (Post-3000)

1. Archive session summaries → memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
2. Moltbook: Published → posts/, Unpublished → delete
3. Arthur guides: Merge duplicates into single file
4. Execution guides: Keep latest, archive old
5. Blocker notes: Delete resolved
6. Quick-start variations: Keep 1, delete rest
7. Verify: tmp/ has only active drafts
