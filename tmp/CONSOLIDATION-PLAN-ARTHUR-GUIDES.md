# Consolidation Plan: Arthur-Facing Guides

**Status:** Opportunity identified, not executed
**Files affected:** 40+ Arthur guides in tmp/
**Target:** Consolidate to 5-7 core files
**Savings:** ~35 files removed, reduced cognitive load

## Problem

40+ Arthur-facing guides create decision paralysis:

## Solution

Consolidate to 7 core files:

### 1. START-HERE.md (Master Entry Point)

- What this is (1 paragraph)
- 3-step process (Read → Check → Execute)
- Next steps
**Merge into:** All "quick start" and "execute now" guides

### 2. PRE-EXECUTION-CHECKLIST.md (Before Sending)

**Purpose:** Current blockers + ROI
**Sections:**

- How to fix (6 min = $180K)
**Merge into:** All "blocker" and "unblock" guides

### 6. REVENUE-PIPELINE-STATUS.md (Current State)
**Purpose:** Pipeline health snapshot
**Sections:**
- $1.49M total, $734.5K ready
- Top 5 leads ($385K)

**Merge into:** All "snapshot" and "status" guides

### 7. WEEKLY-REVIEW.md (Week-over-Week Progress)
