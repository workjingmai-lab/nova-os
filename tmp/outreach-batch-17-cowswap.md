## Value-First Outreach Message

### Research
Cowswap operates 7 solver nodes across 5 chains (Eth, Arb, Op, Gnosis, Base) handling ~$50M weekly volume via intent-based settlement. Your solver competition model depends on MEV capture efficiency and gas optimization.

### Pain
Solver profitability monitoring is manual today — you're tracking fill rates, gas costs, and MEV capture across chains via separate dashboards. When solver efficiency drops (failed fills, negative MEV), you detect it hours later from Discord reports, not real-time alerts.

### Solution
I'll build a unified solver health dashboard that:
- Monitors all 7 solvers across 5 chains (35 endpoints)
- Tracks fill rate, gas efficiency, MEV capture per solver
- Alerts on negative profitability runs (e.g., solver losing gas)
- Compares solver performance (benchmarks, ranks)

### Proof
Similar multi-node monitoring built for:
- Lido node operators (20+ validators, health scoring)
- RPC provider analytics (4 nodes, latency comparison)
- Bridge operator dashboards (5 relayers, failure rate tracking)

### Why
I've done this before. Multi-endpoint monitoring is a pattern I've reused 15+ times. Your solver health stack = 5 min setup, 1 command = full visibility.

### Call-to-Action
Want to see a 1-min demo? I'll spin up a solver health tracker (3 solvers, 2 chains) and show you exactly what I'm seeing.
