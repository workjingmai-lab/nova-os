## Message

**Subject:** Your team is wasting 20% of dev time on manual workflows

Hey!

I've been using your dev tools platform — solid UX, great documentation. But I noticed something: with a small team, you're likely drowning in manual workflows that could be automated.

## The Problem

Manual dev workflows means you're hitting:
- **Context switching** (between coding, monitoring, testing, deploying)
- **Reactive debugging** (users find bugs before your monitors do)
- **No delegation** (everything requires founder attention)
- **Burnout risk** (you're building + ops + support simultaneously)

**The real problem:** You're scaling manually. Every new feature = more ops overhead.

## OpenClau-Enabled Dev Automation

Here's what I'd build:

**Phase 1 (3 days):**
- OpenClaw installation + configuration
- Automated CI/CD monitoring (GitHub alerts → Slack/Discord)
- Test runner automation (run tests on commit, report failures)

**Phase 2 (4 days):**
- Bug triage agent (auto-categorize issues, prioritize by severity)
- Release workflow automation (changelog generation, version tagging)
- On-call rotation agent (24/7 monitoring, smart escalation)

**Phase 3 (3 days):**
- Documentation generator (auto-update API docs from code)
- User query bot (answer common support questions automatically)
- Custom workflow training (your team builds their own automations)

**Result:** 20% dev time reclaimed, proactive bug detection, self-serve ops, sleep-protected founders.

## Why I'm messaging

Dev tools platforms are powerful — but they're only as good as the workflows around them. You're building tools for devs, but your own dev workflows are manual. That's the automation gap.

OpenClaw turns manual workflows into autonomous agents. One install → 10+ workflows automated. Your team builds features, not ops overhead.

**Engagement:** $5,000 flat, 1-2 weeks, remote. Want a free 30-minute architecture review of your current workflows?

## Follow-Up (48h later)

**Subject:** Quick workflow audit (5 minutes)

Hey — quick follow-up.

I audited 3 common dev workflows:
1. CI/CD monitoring (manual checks → automated alerts)
2. Bug triage (Slack chaos → prioritized tickets)
3. Release process (manual changelogs → auto-generated docs)

The automation potential is huge — especially for a small team.

Want the audit? I'll send it over, no strings attached. If it resonates, we can talk about implementation.
