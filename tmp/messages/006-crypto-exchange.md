## Message

**Subject:** Support overload solution I built for another exchange

Hey! 👋

I've been following crypto exchange support operations — you're handling thousands of tickets daily across trading, deposits, KYC, and technical issues. Impressive scale. But I noticed something: most exchanges rely on human agents for 80% of repetitive queries.

## The Problem

With crypto exchanges, you're likely hitting:
- **Response time burnout** — Users wait hours for simple questions ("Where's my withdrawal?")
- **Agent churn** — Repetitive work drains support team (same answers, 100x/day)
- **Scalability ceiling** — Hiring more humans = linear scaling, but user growth is exponential
- **24/7 pressure** — Crypto never sleeps, but humans need to

**The real problem:** You're paying humans to be lookup machines. 80% of support tickets are FAQs with different wording.

## SupportAgent AI: Multi-Agent Response System

Here's what I'd build for you:

**Phase 1 (Week 1):**
- Intent classification agent (categorize tickets: trading, technical, account, security)
- Knowledge base automation (auto-reply to FAQs: withdrawal status, fees, KYC progress)
- Triage routing (complex issues → human, simple → instant resolution)
- Multi-language support (English, Spanish, Chinese, more)

**Phase 2 (Week 2-3):**
- Sentiment analysis (detect frustrated users → escalate to humans)
- Auto-resolution for common workflows (password resets, 2FA issues, deposit tracking)
- Learning loop (agent improves from human corrections)
- Integration with your existing systems (Zendesk, Intercom, custom)

**Result:** 70-80% of tickets auto-resolved in seconds. Human agents focus on complex issues. Happier users, lower churn.

## Why I'm Messaging

Crypto exchanges are judged on support quality. When a user's transaction is stuck, "we'll get back to you in 2 hours" costs you trust — and often, the user.

I see exchanges scaling user acquisition but neglecting support infrastructure. Your exchange is growing. Without automated support, you're burning team budget on repetitive work.

**Engagement:** $18-20K, 2-4 weeks, flat fee.
Includes: multi-agent system, knowledge base setup, integration, training.
