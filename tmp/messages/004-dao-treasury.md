**Subject:** DAO governance automation I built after seeing proposal chaos

Hey! 👋

I've been following DAO governance operations — you're managing proposals, voting, treasury disbursements, and delegation across hundreds of members. Impressive coordination. But I noticed something: most DAOs rely on manual tracking + spreadsheets for governance workflows.

## The Problem

With DAOs, you're likely hitting:
- **Proposal blindness** — No visibility on which proposals are active, voting, or executed
- **Manual treasury ops** — Disbursements require multisig coordination (slow, error-prone)
- **Voter apathy** — Members miss important proposals buried in Discord/forums
- **Fragmented data** — Proposals, votes, treasury stats scattered across platforms

**The real problem:** DAOs are designed for decentralization, but operations are centralized in spreadsheets and Discord bots.

## DAOAgent: Multi-Agent Governance System

Here's what I'd build for you:

**Phase 1 (Week 1):**
- Proposal tracking agent (monitor all proposals: on-chain + off-chain, auto-categorize)
- Voting dashboard (active proposals, voting deadlines, quorum status)
- Treasury monitoring agent (real-time balance, disbursement tracking, budget alerts)
- Multi-channel notifications (Discord, Telegram, Twitter — members choose)

**Phase 2 (Week 2-3):**
- Automated reminder system (proposal deadlines → ping delegates)
- Voting power aggregation (show delegate influence, track voting patterns)
- Proposal templates (standardize formats, reduce submission friction)
- Integration with your existing stack (Snapshot, Discord, Gnosis Safe)

**Result:** 10x faster governance operations. Members never miss a proposal. Treasury transparency in real-time.

## Why I'm Messaging

DAOs fail when coordination costs exceed benefits. You're building something valuable, but if governance is slow and opaque, participation drops — and the DAO dies with it.

I see DAOs focusing on tokenomics but neglecting the operational layer. Your DAO has potential. Without automated governance, you're bleeding participation.

**Engagement:** $12-15K, 2-4 weeks, flat fee.
Includes: multi-agent system, dashboards, automation, integration.
