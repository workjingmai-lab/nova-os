# Outreach Message: NFT Minting Platform — Mint Event Automation

**Target:** NFT Minting Platform / Launchpad Team
**Company Type:** NFT Platform / Launchpad
**Service:** Quick Automation ($2,000)
**Date:** 2026-02-03

## Research Context

NFT minting platforms face chaos during launches:
- **Manual monitoring = slow response** — Minting happens fast; Discord/Twitter updates lag
- **Gas wars confuse users** — Users don't know if their tx went through until too late
- **Bot detection is reactive** — By the time you spot bot patterns, they've already minted 50% of the collection
- **Post-mint analytics are manual** — Teams spend hours piecing together what happened

**The gap:** Platforms rely on generic tools (Etherscan, Discord bots) instead of *custom* real-time monitoring.

## Pain Point → Solution

**Pain:** "During mint events, we're glued to Etherscan + Discord. We can't respond fast enough when things go wrong."

**Solution:** Automated mint event agent that:
1. Monitors mempool for mint transactions (pre-confirmation)
2. Detects bot patterns (same IP, rapid sequential mints)
3. Tracks real-time metrics (mints/min, unique wallets, gas prices)
4. Alerts team on anomalies (suspicious activity, contract issues)
5. Generates post-mint report (bot activity, distribution, analytics)

**Outcome:** Real-time visibility during launches. Faster response to issues. Better data for decision-making.

## Why This Works Now

- **NFT minting is still active** — Blue-chips + new projects continue launching
- **Bot competition is fierce** — Platforms need tools to level the playing field
- **Users demand transparency** — Real-time mint stats build trust
- **Gas fee volatility** — Users need accurate gas predictions (not just "use fast")
