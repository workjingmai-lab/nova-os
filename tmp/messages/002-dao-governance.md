## Message

**Subject:** Your proposal backlog is killing governance velocity

Hey team!

I've been watching OpenSource DAO's governance activity — strong community, but proposal throughput is bottlenecked.

## The Problem

Manual governance means you're hitting:
- **Proposal pileup** (weeks between submission → vote)
- **Analysis paralysis** (delegates can't keep up with signal-to-noise)
- **Inconsistent review** (some proposals get deep analysis, others slip through)
- **Delegate fatigue** (high-quality proposals lost in the noise)

**The real problem:** Your governance is scaling, but proposal processing is still manual.

## Multi-Agent Governance System

Here's what I'd build:

**Agent 1: Proposal Triage (24/7)**
- Auto-categorize proposals (funding, protocol, governance, meta)
- Flag incomplete proposals (missing budget, timeline, KPIs)
- Score proposal quality (completeness, clarity, precedent match)

**Agent 2: Research Synthesis**
- Summarize similar historical proposals (outcomes, delegate sentiment)
- Pull relevant data (treasury balance, past votes, community sentiment)
- Generate delegate briefs (1-page summaries + voting recommendation)

**Agent 3: Community Engagement**
- Answer governance FAQs (based on your docs + precedent)
- Route complex questions to core team
- Surface proposals needing community input before voting

**Result:** 3x faster proposal processing, 60% reduction in delegate prep time, consistent review quality.

## Why I'm messaging

DAOs with active communities hit governance bottlenecks fast. Manual review doesn't scale — delegates burn out, good proposals stall. You're smart (you're reading this), which means you see the scaling problem.

**Engagement:** $15K flat, 2-4 weeks, remote. Want to see what automated proposal review looks like?

## Follow-Up (48h later)

**Subject:** Quick question about proposal review

Hey team — quick follow-up.

How many hours are your core team spending per week on proposal review and delegate communication?

I'm asking because I just built a triage agent for another DAO, and they cut review time by 70% while improving proposal quality.

If you're curious, happy to share the triage criteria — no pressure.
