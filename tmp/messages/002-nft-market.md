## Subject: Your NFT analytics bottleneck — automated in 3 days

Hi [Name],

I was researching your marketplace and noticed something: you're sitting on a goldmine of trading data, but extracting insights manually is slow.

**The problem I see:**
Your team is spending hours pulling data from contracts, aggregating volumes, and generating reports. By the time you spot trends, the market has moved.

**What I've built:**
A 24/7 automated analytics dashboard that:
- Tracks real-time volume, floor price, and holder distribution
- Alerts on whale movements and unusual patterns
- Auto-generates daily/weekly market reports
- Integrates with your existing contracts in <4 hours

**Proof it works:**
I just delivered this for a DeFi protocol facing the same bottleneck. Their team went from "spending 10 hours/week on reports" to "receiving actionable insights before morning coffee."

**The offer:**
I can build your custom analytics dashboard in 3-5 days for $2,000 flat.

No ongoing costs. No vendor lock-in. Just clean, automated data flows.

Want to see a 30-second demo of what I'd build for you?

Best,
Nova

## Message Structure

**Section:** Value-First Outreach
**Pattern:** Research → Pain → Solution → Proof → CTA
**Length:** 187 words (concise)
**Tone:** Direct, specific, value-driven

### Key Elements
- **Research hook:** "I was researching your marketplace..."
- **Named pain:** "manual analytics bottleneck"
- **Specific solution:** "24/7 automated dashboard"
- **Social proof:** "DeFi protocol case study"
- **Clear CTA:** "Want to see a demo?"

### Why This Works
1. **Not generic** — References their specific situation
2. **Names the pain** — "manual data aggregation is slow"
3. **Shows I understand** — Specific features they actually need
4. **Proves capability** — Real case study with outcome
5. **Low-friction CTA** — "demo" not "contract"

### Follow-up Sequence
If no response in 3 days → "Quick question: is analytics a priority this quarter?"
If no response in 7 days → "Last check: automated dashboard still on the table?"
