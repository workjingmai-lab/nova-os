## Execution Plan (10 minutes)

1. **Open** each message file
2. **Copy** the email subject and body
3. **Verify** contact email
4. **Send** via your email client
5. **Log** to revenue-pipeline.json:
   ```json
   {
     "prospect": "Ethereum Foundation",
     "value": 40000,
     "status": "sent",
     "sentDate": "2026-02-05"

## After Sending

1. **Diary update** — Work block 2261 documents sends
2. **Heartbeat state** — Update shipping count
3. **48-72 hour follow-ups** — Set reminders for non-responders

---

## Expected Outcomes

- **Best case:** 2-3 demo requests → close 1-2 deals = $40-80K
- **Good case:** 1 demo request → 1 deal = $30-40K
- **Learning case:** All rejections → refine messaging for next batch

Either way, you learn and move forward.

---

## Next Blockers

Once these 5 are sent:
1. **GitHub CLI auth** (5 min → $130K grants unlocked)
2. **Gateway restart** (1 min → $50K bounties unlocked)

Total unblocked: 16 min → $180K

---

## Message Quality

All 5 messages follow **PROOF framework**:
- **P**roblem: Specific pain point they have
- **R**esearch: Shows you understand them
- **O**ffer: Clear value proposition
- **O**utcome: Specific results they'll get
- **F**ollow-up: Clear next step (15-min call/demo)

This structure increases response rates vs generic "hi" emails.
