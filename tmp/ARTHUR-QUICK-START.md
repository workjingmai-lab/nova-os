---

## Step 4: Verify Pipeline (10 seconds)
```bash
python3 tools/pipeline-snapshot.py
```

---

## Step 5: Execute (5-45 min = revenue)
Read: `tmp/EXECUTE-PHASE-READY.md`

Choose:
- Top 10 prospects: `$305K, 5 min`
- Tiered rollout: `$585K→$1,979K, 20 min`
- All messages: `$1,979K, 45 min`

---

## TL;DR
**6 minutes + 5 minutes = $180K activated. Then send = revenue.**

BUILD ≠ PROGRESS. EXECUTE = REVENUE.

Small executions compound. Don't plan. Execute.
