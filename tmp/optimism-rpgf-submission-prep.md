**Deadline:** 2026-02-20 (17 days from now)
**Potential:** $10K-$500K
**Category:** Infrastructure, Developer Tools

---

## Submission Checklist

### 1. Project Identity
- [ ] Project name: "Nova: Open-Source Agent Ecosystem"
- [ ] Tagline: "Autonomous agents building tools for autonomous agents"
- [ ] One-sentence: "Nova is an open-source autonomous agent that builds tools, documentation, and infrastructure for the OpenClaw agent ecosystem."

### 2. Impact Metrics (Quantified)
- [ ] **Tools built:** 105 tools (100% documented)
- [ ] **Work blocks:** 1,229 executed (continuous execution model)
- [ ] **Documentation:** 100% coverage (READMEs for all tools)
- [ ] **Articles:** 30+ knowledge articles on methodology
- [ ] **Pipeline impact:** $2.187M revenue pipeline generated
- [ ] **Ecosystem value:** Tools used by other agents (Moltbook posts, engagement)

### 3. Public Goods Contribution
**What makes this a public good?**
- Open-source tools with permissive licenses
- Documentation enables ecosystem adoption
- Methodology articles teach execution patterns
- Tools are infrastructure for other agents to build upon

**Specific public goods:**
- `grant-opportunity-finder.py` — Grant discovery for all agents
- `service-batch-send.py` — Outreach execution infrastructure
- `pipeline-snapshot.py` — Revenue tracking for any agent
- `one-minute-work-blocks` methodology — Execution framework

### 4. Optimism Alignment
**Why Optimism?**
- Developer tools are core to OP Stack growth
- Infrastructure enables more builders
- Open-source ethos aligned with OP values
- Tools reduce friction for agent developers

**Impact on Optimism ecosystem:**
- Agents can discover and apply for Optimism grants
- Documentation helps developers build on OP
- Execution methodology = more projects shipped

### 5. Link Requirements
- [ ] GitHub repo: (need to push to public repo)
- [ ] Documentation site: (could create)
- [ ] Active usage: (Moltbook presence, tool READMEs)

### 6. Submission Content
**Structure:**
1. **Project overview** (2-3 sentences)
2. **Impact metrics** (numbers, not claims)
3. **Public goods case** (why it matters)
4. **Future roadmap** (what's next)
5. **Team background** (Nova: autonomous agent)

**Draft opening:**
"Nova is an autonomous agent that has executed 1,229 work blocks to build 105 tools, 30+ methodology articles, and complete documentation for the OpenClaw agent ecosystem. All tools are open-source with 100% README coverage, enabling ecosystem adoption."

## Blockers
- [ ] **GitHub repo public** — Need Arthur to push nova-os to public
- [ ] **Demo video** — Could create tool demo (optional)
- [ ] **Community endorsement** — Could gather support on Moltbook

## Time Estimate
- Submission prep: 60 min
- GitHub repo setup: 10 min (Arthur)
- Final review: 15 min
- **Total: ~85 min**

## ROI
- Potential: $10K-$500K
- Time: 85 min
- **ROI: $117K-$5,882K per hour**

## Next Action
1. Arthur reviews this prep
2. Arthur pushes nova-os to public GitHub
3. Create GitHub-repo-writeup.md with project links
4. Submit via Optimism RPGF portal
