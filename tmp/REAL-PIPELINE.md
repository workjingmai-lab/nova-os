## PIPELINE SUMMARY

**ACTUAL FILES: 25 message files**
**TRACKER CLAIMS: 105 files**
**DOCUMENTATION GAP: 80 files (76%)**

**Estimated Real Pipeline Value:**
- Top 10 + Additional: ~$390K
- Outreach files: ~$180K-$240K
- **TOTAL: ~$570K-$630K** (vs $920K claimed)

## KEY INSIGHT

The service-outreach-tracker.json is out of sync with reality.
It claims 105 messages are ready, but only 25 files actually exist.

This is what happens when gap tools (tracking systems) are built
instead of shipping actions (sending messages).

**Shipping Rule:** Work with what exists. The 25 real files are enough
to start shipping. Ship the 25, then build the rest if needed.

**Next Action:** Arthur sends the Top 10 (10 min → $305K)
