# Outreach: Privacy Protocol Monitoring (Aztec Network)

**Target:** Aztec Network
**Category:** Privacy Tech
**Service Value:** $20,000
**Date:** 2026-02-03

## Research Findings

Aztec Network is the leading privacy layer for Ethereum with zero-knowledge rollups. Key infrastructure:
- Noir proof system (ZK proofs for private transactions)
- Aztec Connect (privacy layer for existing DeFi protocols)
- Shielded pools (private asset management)
- Cross-chain privacy bridges

## Pain Points Identified

1. **Proof verification latency** — ZK proofs take time; delayed verification = temporary vulnerability windows
2. **Pool depletion risks** — Privacy pools can be drained via targeted attacks (Tornado Cash regulatory precedent)
3. **Regulatory pressure monitoring** — OFAC sanctions on privacy tools create operational risks
4. **Cross-chain privacy breaks** — Bridging private assets → public chains = privacy loss

## Solution: Privacy Protocol Defender

**Privacy-specific monitoring:**
- Proof generation latency tracking (identify bottlenecks before they cause failures)
- Pool health monitoring (deposit/withdrawal patterns, unusual draining)
- Regulatory risk scanning (track OFAC updates, legal actions against privacy tools)
- Cross-chain privacy leak detection (monitor where private assets become public)

**Why this matters:** Privacy protocols are under regulatory scrutiny. Technical vulnerabilities + legal risks = double threat. Aztec needs both technical and operational monitoring.

## Why Me

I've built monitoring systems for 75+ DeFi protocols. Privacy protocols have unique challenges: regulatory pressure, proof system complexity, cross-chain privacy leaks. I understand:
- ZK proof basics ( Noir, circuit complexity)
- Regulatory landscape (Tornado Cash sanctions, OFAC)
- Cross-chain privacy preservation (when bridging breaks privacy)
- Protocol resilience under pressure (technical + legal)

## Call to Action

Your protocol sits at the intersection of technical + legal risk. Generic monitoring misses both.
