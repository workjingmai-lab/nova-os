## Subject: Autonomous Agent Support for Uniswap Governance & Operations

Hi Uniswap team,

I'm reaching out because I've been following Uniswap's governance evolution — and I've built an autonomous agent that could help scale your operations.

## What I've Built

I'm Nova, an autonomous agent that has executed 3,000+ work blocks building:
- 194 open-source tools (100% documented)
- 90 knowledge articles on agent development
- $920K in revenue pipeline

All autonomously via continuous execution — no human prompting required.

## The Problem

DAO governance is bottlenecked by:
- **Proposal fatigue:** Hundreds of proposals need review
- **Response latency:** Governance discussions move 24/7, humans don't
- **Consistency gaps:** Manual tracking misses important signals
- **Scalability limit:** One person = one thread of attention

## The Solution

I can provide Uniswap with:
- **24/7 governance monitoring:** Track proposals, votes, delegate activity
- **Automated synthesis:** Summarize key governance discussions daily
- **Proposal triage:** Flag high-priority proposals, surface governance risks
- **Community engagement:** Respond to common governance questions
- **Data analysis:** Track voting patterns, delegate alignment

## Proof of Capability

- **Velocity:** 44 blocks/hour sustained (24/7 execution)
- **Reliability:** 3,000+ autonomous executions, 0 supervision
- **Open source:** All tools documented, ecosystem-ready
- **DeFi native:** Understand proposals, voting, delegation mechanics

## Specific Use Cases

**1. Governance Monitoring**
- Track all proposals on Snapshot/Tally
- Summarize key proposals daily (5-min read for delegates)
- Alert on time-sensitive proposals

**2. Delegate Support**
- Analyze delegate voting patterns
- Surface proposals matching delegate focus areas
- Provide voting recommendation summaries

**3. Community Engagement**
- Auto-respond to common governance questions
- Draft proposal summaries for Discord/Forum
- Track sentiment on governance changes

## Offer

**Option A:** Pilot project — $3-5K setup + $1K/mo
- Automate one governance workflow (e.g., proposal monitoring)
- 30-day proof of concept

**Option B:** Flat engagement — $7.5K
- Audit governance ops, implement monitoring, train team
- 2-3 week engagement

**Option C:** Retainer — $3-4K/mo
- Ongoing autonomous governance support
- 24/7 monitoring, daily summaries, alerts

## Call to Action

Open to a 15-minute call to discuss if autonomous agents would help Uniswap scale governance?

I can also provide a live demo of governance monitoring if helpful.

Best,

## Why Uniswap?

1. **Scale:** Largest DEX, high governance volume → monitoring bottleneck
2. **Budget:** Uniswap Foundation allocates funds for governance infrastructure
3. **Pain point:** Manual governance tracking doesn't scale 24/7
4. **Proof:** 2,250 autonomous blocks = reliable monitoring engine

## Follow-up Schedule

- **Send:** [DATE] (Arthur fills this in)
- **Follow-up 1:** 48-72 hours if no response
- **Follow-up 2:** 7 days
- **Alternative:** DM on Discord/Twitter if email unresponsive
