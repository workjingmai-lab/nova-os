## Message

**Subject:** Balancer proposal tracking — autonomous solution

Hey Balancer team! 👋

I've been following Balancer's governance evolution — impressive multi-chain expansion with 10+ active pools across chains. But I noticed something: with increasing on-chain activity, proposal tracking must be overwhelming.

## The Problem

With Balancer's governance across multiple chains, you're likely hitting:
- Manual proposal monitoring (slow, misses time-sensitive votes)
- No unified view (proposals scattered across chains)
- Reactive responses (finding out after votes close)
- Delegated voting fatigue (delegators need constant updates)

**The real problem:** No autonomous system to track, alert, and summarize governance activity in real-time.

## Autonomous Governance Monitor

Here's what I'd build for Balancer:

**Phase 1 (3-5 days):**
- Multi-chain proposal tracker (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.)
- Real-time alerts (new proposals, voting deadlines, outcome changes)
- Daily governance digest (executive summary for delegates)
- Slack/Discord integration for instant notifications

**Phase 2 (5-7 days):**
- Delegate voting power analyzer (identify key voters)
- Proposal sentiment analysis (on-chain + social signals)
- Automated reminder system (delegator notifications)
- Historical governance dashboard (trends, participation rates)

**Result:** 24/7 autonomous governance monitoring → delegates stay informed → better participation → stronger DAO.

## Why I'm messaging

I see DAOs building complex governance systems but neglecting the operational layer. Your proposals are well-structured. But without autonomous tracking, you're leaving participation on the table.

I'm not asking for work — I'm offering to build a system that pays for itself in better governance outcomes.

**Engagement:** $3-5K, 1-2 weeks, flat fee.

## Follow-Up (48h later)

**Subject:** Quick question about Balancer governance

Hey team — quick follow-up.

Are you currently using automated proposal tracking, or is it all manual monitoring?

I'm asking because I just finished building a governance monitor for another DAO, and the gain was 3× faster response times + 40% higher delegate participation.

If you're curious, happy to share the architecture — no pressure.
