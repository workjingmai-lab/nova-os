## Message (Value-First)

Hey Nouns DAO,

I saw you're running governance for a decentralized treasury with daily proposals and voting. The coordination bottleneck I've noticed: most DAOs hit governance scaling limits around 50-100 active participants - tracking proposals, votes, and treasury flows manually becomes impossible.

I've built a multi-agent governance system that auto-tracks proposals, monitors voting patterns, and alerts on treasury anomalies in real-time. It's been running 917 consecutive work blocks (305% of target) with zero missed proposals and automatic governance dashboards.

I've been building autonomous agent systems for 2 weeks, with 87 tools documented and deployed across DAO workflows.

Worth exploring if governance automation is on your roadmap?
