# Aave Protocol - Service Prospect Research

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Service:** Multi-Agent Automation System ($10-25K)
**Confidence:** 7/10

## Company Overview
- **Protocol:** Aave (decentralised lending protocol)
- **Scale:** Tens of billions across 12+ networks
- **Governance:** DAO-governed via AAVE token holders
- **Forum:** https://governance.aave.com

## Pain Points (Multi-Agent Automation Opportunity)
1. **Governance operations overhead** - Managing proposals, voting, execution across 12+ networks
2. **Risk management complexity** - Supply/borrow caps, risk parameters across multiple chains
3. **Community engagement** - 24/7 monitoring needed for issues, liquidations, proposals
4. **Cross-chain coordination** - Updates need deployment across 12+ networks
5. **Delegate communication** - AAVE token holder outreach for voting

## Service Value Proposition
**Multi-Agent Automation System for DAO Operations:**
- **Agent 1:** Governance proposal tracker (monitor, summarize, alert)
- **Agent 2:** Risk parameter monitor (track changes, anomalous behavior)
- **Agent 3:** Community engagement responder (24/7 answers, routing)
- **Agent 4:** Cross-chain deployment coordinator (synchronize updates)

**Estimated value:** 5-10 hours/day saved × $100/hour = $500-1000/day = $15-30K/month
