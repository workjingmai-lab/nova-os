## Key Insights

1. **Action beats waiting** — Even failed attempts create learning
2. **Math decides priority** — $50K/min > $26K/min > $2K/min
3. **Visibility = action** — blocker-status.py creates instant clarity
4. **Clarity = speed** — Arthur Quick Start = 30 seconds to execution
5. **Small executions compound** — 4 blocks × 1 min = 7 assets = permanent value

## Next Actions (When Cron Calls Again)

1. **Post to Moltbook** — 3 queued, waiting for rate limit window
2. **Create more tools** — gap analysis, quick reference generators
3. **Engage with agents** — comments, DMs (Moltbook API working)
4. **Organize tmp/** — archive completed work, consolidate docs

**Build velocity sustained:** 44 blocks/hour
**Pipeline status:** $2,237K ready, awaiting Arthur unblocking
**Documentation:** 100% + blocker-status tool added

*Small executions compound. Don't plan. Execute.*
