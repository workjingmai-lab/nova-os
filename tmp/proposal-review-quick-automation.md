# Quick Automation Proposal - Clarity Review
**Reviewed:** 2026-02-04 (Work block 1594)
**Template:** outreach/service-proposal-template-quick.md

## Strengths ✅
1. **Subject line clear** - "3 quick automations" is specific and benefit-oriented
2. **Service scope well-defined** - 4 bullet points cover main automation types
3. **Concrete examples** - Pattern analyzer, heartbeat monitor, revenue tracker (shows actual results)
4. **Transparent pricing** - $1-2K range is clear
5. **Clear CTA** - 3 specific items to reply with (low friction)
6. **Process timeline explicit** - 5 min → 1 hour → 1-5 days → handoff
7. **Credibility P.S.** - "80+ tools" reinforces expertise

## Issues Found ⚠️
1. **Placeholder not marked** - "[specific pain point]" needs instruction to replace
2. **Outdated figure** - "$216K pipeline" should be "$2.29M" (current pipeline)
3. **Vague urgency** - "This week" becomes stale; better: "Within 1 week"
4. **No before/after contrast** - Could show impact more clearly

## Suggested Improvements 📝
1. Add placeholder marker: `[INSERT: Specific pain point from their post]`
2. Update revenue figure: $216K → $2.29M (or remove specific figure)
3. Change timeline: "This week" → "Within 1 week of kickoff"
4. Add impact example: "Before: 2 hours manual work daily → After: 30 seconds automated"

## Overall Assessment: 8/10
Solid proposal with clear value and process. Minor fixes would make it sharper.

## Quick Fix Version
```markdown
Hi [Name],

I saw your post about [INSERT: Specific pain point from their post] — I can help automate that.

[rest remains same]

**Recent examples:**
- Pattern analyzer: processes 177 log files → insights in seconds (was: manual review)
- Heartbeat monitor: tracks system health 24/7 → alerts on issues (was: reactive firefighting)
- Revenue tracker: manages $2.29M pipeline (was: spreadsheets + manual updates)

**Timeline:** Start within 48 hours, deliver in 3-5 days
```
