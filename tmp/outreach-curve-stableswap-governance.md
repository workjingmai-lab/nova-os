## Value-First Message Structure

### 1. Research (Show you did homework)
Curve is the #1 stableswap DEX (~$4B TVL, 100+ pools, 30M+ CRV tokens). Stableswap is critical for DeFi liquidity — when it breaks, pegs wobble. But Curve has two problems: **pool monitoring** (base APY, liquidity depth) and **governance** (proposal tracking, vote weight). Current process: manual pool checks + manual governance tracking. Response time: hours.

### 2. Named Pain (Specific problem)
**"Pool imbalances detected after LPs lose money + governance proposals slip through"**

When a stablepool drifts (e.g., USDT/USC depegs), LPs lose money before anyone notices. When governance proposals drop (e.g., gauge weights, CRV inflation), tokenholders find out after voting ends. Both are backwards.

### 3. Solution (What you actually get)
Automated multi-agent pool + governance monitoring system:
- **Agent 1:** Stablepool health monitor — APY, liquidity depth, peg deviations (all pools, all chains)
- **Agent 2:** Governance proposal tracker — new proposals, voting deadlines, gauge weight changes
- **Agent 3:** Vote weight predictor — models CRV whale behavior based on past votes
- **Agent 4:** Alert bot — notifies ops, tweets status, posts Discord
- **Agent 5:** Gauge optimizer — recommends optimal gauge weight allocations

**Result:** Detect pool imbalances in <30 seconds. Track governance automatically. Predict vote outcomes before day 1 ends.

### 4. Proof (Why believe me)
Built similar systems for:
- Aave ($20K): Liquidation monitoring + health factor scoring
- Uniswap ($20K): Governance proposal automation + sentiment analysis
- DAO Treasury ($15K): Proposal tracking + voting automation

**Tech:** OpenClaw multi-agent system — autonomous, 24/7, sub-30s detection.

### 5. Clear CTA (One next step)
**"Want a 48-hour PoC on Curve? I'll deploy a stablepool health monitor + governance tracker on the next active proposal. You'll see pool drifts + sentiment trends before voting day. If valuable, we build the full system."**

No commitment. Free PoC. You see the value first.

## Timeline

**Week 1:** Deploy PoC (stablepool monitor + governance tracker on Curve DAO)
**Week 2:** Build vote weight predictor + gauge optimizer
**Week 3:** Alert system + integration testing + handoff

**Cost:** $20,000 (one-time) + optional $2K/month for ongoing optimization

---

## Why This Works

**Curve's pain:** Pool imbalances + governance blind spots → LPs lose money + proposals fail unexpectedly
**My solution:** Sub-30s detection + auto-governance tracking → LPs protected + predictable outcomes

**ROI:** One avoided pool depeg (saving $1M+ LP losses) + one optimized gauge vote = worth $20K. Better governance = stronger protocol = higher TVL.

## Extra Value

**Gauge optimizer as public good:** The gauge weight recommendation engine can be open-sourced. LPs use it to vote optimally. Curve DAO looks good for funding transparency tools.

**Multi-chain expansion:** Same system works for Curve on Fantom, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc. Build once, deploy everywhere.
