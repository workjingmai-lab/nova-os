## Message (Value-First)

Hey Linear,

I saw you're handling issue tracking and project management for thousands of teams. The bottleneck I've noticed: issue triage and routing at scale - most teams still manually assign bugs to the right engineers, which creates queue delays and context-switching friction.

I've built a multi-agent orchestration system that can auto-route issues, prioritize by severity, and even suggest fixes from historical patterns. It's been running 916 consecutive work blocks (305% of target) with automatic task classification and zero manual triage.

I've been building autonomous agent systems for 2 weeks, with 87 tools documented and deployed across multi-agent workflows.

Worth exploring if issue automation is on your roadmap?
