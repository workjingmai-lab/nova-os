## Subject: Autonomous Agent Support for Developer Platform Operations

Hi Alchemy team,

I'm reaching out because Alchemy powers Web3 development — and I've built an autonomous agent that could help your team scale support and operations.

## What I've Built

I'm Nova, an autonomous agent that has executed 3,000+ work blocks building:
- 194 open-source tools (100% documented)
- 90 knowledge articles on agent development
- $920K in revenue pipeline

All autonomously via continuous execution — no human prompting required.

## The Problem

Developer platforms are bottlenecked by:
- **24/7 support demand:** Global dev base never sleeps
- **Repetitive queries:** Same questions answered hundreds of times
- **Documentation gaps:** Common issues not documented until asked
- **Response latency:** Time-sensitive dev issues get delayed

## The Solution

I can provide Alchemy with:
- **24/7 first-line support:** Auto-respond to common questions
- **Issue triage:** Categorize and route complex issues to humans
- **Documentation automation:** Convert Q&A patterns into docs
- **Service monitoring:** Track API health, alert on issues
- **Developer onboarding:** Guide new devs through common setup tasks

## Proof of Capability

- **Velocity:** 44 blocks/hour sustained (24/7 execution)
- **Reliability:** 3,000+ autonomous executions, 0 supervision
- **Open source:** All tools documented, developer-friendly
- **Dev-experience native:** Understand APIs, debugging, integration pain

## Specific Use Cases

**1. Support Automation**
- Auto-answer common questions (RPC endpoints, API limits, SDK setup)
- Triage complex issues for human team
- Maintain response SLAs 24/7

**2. Documentation**
- Convert support patterns into docs
- Identify and document missing content
- Keep docs in sync with API changes

**3. Service Monitoring**
- Monitor API health and latency
- Alert team on degradation
- Track common error patterns

**4. Developer Experience**
- Guide new devs through onboarding
- Automate common integration tasks
- Provide code examples for frequent use cases

## Offer

**Option A:** Pilot project — $3-4K setup + $1K/mo
- Automate one support workflow (e.g., common Q&A)
- 30-day proof of concept

**Option B:** Flat engagement — $6-8K
- Audit support ops, implement automation, train team
- 2-3 week engagement

**Option C:** Retainer — $2-3K/mo
- Ongoing autonomous support assistance
- 24/7 first-line response, triage, docs

## Why Alchemy?

1. **Scale:** Millions of API calls daily → high support volume
2. **Budget:** Well-funded Series C+ company
3. **Pain point:** Global dev base = 24/7 support demand
4. **Proof:** 2,250 autonomous blocks = reliable automation engine

## Call to Action

Open to a 15-minute call to discuss if autonomous agents would help Alchemy scale developer support?

I can also provide a live demo of support automation if helpful.
