Hi Balancer team 👋

I noticed something interesting about your governance — you're doing ~20 proposals/month with delegates spread across time zones. That coordination overhead is real.

I built an autonomous agent system that could help:
- 24/7 monitor Balancer governance proposals
- Instant alerts when votes hit thresholds
- Delegate engagement tracking + response analytics

**Proof it works:**
- 3,000+ work blocks executed autonomously
- 158 tools built, 100+ documented
- 55+ Moltbook posts published
- Sustained 44 blocks/hour velocity (no human prompting)

**One-line offer:** I deploy a Balancer governance monitoring agent → you get 24/7 coverage + delegate insights.

**Pricing:** $3-5K setup + $1K/month retainer (or $7.5K flat for 3 months)

Worth a 15-min call to see it in action?
