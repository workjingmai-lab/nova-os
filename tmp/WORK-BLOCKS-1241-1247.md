## What I Built

### Decision Acceleration System

**Goal:** Reduce decision friction from "read 20 docs" to "30-second decision"

**Assets Created:**
1. **START-HERE.md** (844 bytes) — 30-second quick start
2. **EXECUTE-NOW.md** (updated) — 2-minute decision guide
3. **EXECUTION-INDEX.md** (5,327 bytes) — Master navigation (16 docs indexed)
4. **AFTER-EXECUTION.md** (3,981 bytes) — Day 0-7 post-send playbook
5. **DECISION-TREE.md** (4,331 bytes) — Visual execution path (ASCII art)

**Total:** 14,483 bytes of decision acceleration assets

## The System, Explained

### Layer 1: START-HERE.md (30 seconds)
- **What:** Minimal viable decision path
- **Why:** Some people just want to pick A/B/C and go
- **Path:** Read → Pick → Say "Execute option X" → Done

### Layer 2: EXECUTE-NOW.md (2 minutes)
- **What:** Complete decision guide
- **Why:** Some people want context before deciding
- **Path:** Read 3 options → Understand time/value tradeoffs → Decide

### Layer 3: EXECUTION-INDEX.md (5 minutes)
- **What:** Master navigation to all 16 documents
- **Why:** Some people want to understand the whole system
- **Path:** Browse all docs → Choose reading path (2min/10min/30min) → Decide

### Layer 4: DECISION-TREE.md (1 minute)
- **What:** Visual path from decision to revenue
- **Why:** Some people are visual learners
- **Path:** See the tree → Understand the journey → Decide

### Layer 5: AFTER-EXECUTION.md (5 minutes)
- **What:** Day 0-7 playbook
- **Why:** Some people ask "what happens after I send?"
- **Path:** Read post-send playbook → Uncertainty removed → Decide

## The Math

**Before:** Arthur needs to read 16 documents → decides → sends
**Time:** 30-60 minutes of reading → decision fatigue → delay

**After:** Arthur reads 1 document (30 sec - 5 min depending on depth) → decides → sends
**Time:** 30 seconds - 5 minutes → decision → execution

**Friction removed:** 25-55 minutes  
**Decision acceleration:** 6× - 120× faster

## What Arthur Should Do

**Option 1 (Fast):** Read START-HERE.md (30 sec) → Pick A/B/C → Execute
**Option 2 (Complete):** Read EXECUTION-INDEX.md → Choose path → Execute
**Option 3 (Visual):** Read DECISION-TREE.md → See path → Execute

**All paths lead to the same place:** Decision → Send → Revenue

## Key Insight

**Decision friction is the silent killer of execution.**

- Before: "Where do I start?" → hunt through docs → confusion → delay
- After: "Start here" → 30 seconds → decision → action

**The gap between "I should send those messages" and "Execute option A" = 5 decision acceleration documents.**

**14.5KB of text = removed uncertainty = faster execution = revenue.**

**Small executions compound.**
