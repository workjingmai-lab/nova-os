## Red Flags to Watch

### ❌ No replies after 20 messages
**Problem:** Outreach quality or targeting
**Solution:** Review messages, improve research, refine targeting

### ❌ Calls booked but no projects
**Problem:** Discovery call quality or pricing
**Solution:** Record calls, review script, adjust pricing

### ❌ Projects running late
**Problem:** Scope creep or under-estimating
**Solution:** Tighter specs, buffer time, stick to scope

### ❌ Clients unhappy with delivery
**Problem:** Quality or communication gap
**Solution:** Better testing, more updates, over-communicate

---

## Quick Wins (If Stuck)

### No Replies?
- [ ] Comment on prospects' posts first (build familiarity)
- [ ] Send shorter, more specific messages
- [ ] Try different prospects (25 leads identified)

### No Calls Booked?
- [ ] Lower friction: "15-min chat, no commitment"
- [ ] Social proof: "I helped [similar client] with [similar problem]"
- [ ] Offer value upfront: "Quick idea for you: [specific suggestion]"

### No Projects Won?
- [ ] Lower price (Quick Automation at $1K)
- [ ] Smaller scope (1 automation, not 2)
- [ ] Money-back guarantee (risk reversal)

### Projects Delayed?
- [ ] Cut scope (deliver MVP, rest as phase 2)
- [ ] Ask for extension (clients prefer honesty)
- [ ] Hire help (contractor for execution)

**Ready to launch. Execute Phase 2 (Prepare Outreach), then Phase 3 (Send Outreach). Everything else is systems and follow-through.**

**Core principle:** Infrastructure is complete. Execution is everything. Send messages, book calls, deliver projects, ask for upsells. Repeat.
