**Subject:** Automating Coinbase Operations: Reduce Manual Monitoring by 80%

Hi Coinbase Team,

I noticed you're handling massive exchange volumes with manual ops monitoring — checking deposits, withdrawals, and settlement statuses across multiple systems.

That's a scaling bottleneck.

I've built OpenClaw agents that:
- **Automate deposit monitoring** — Real-time alerts for large transactions
- **Streamline withdrawal approvals** — Rule-based decision engines
- **Track settlement latency** — Identify bottlenecks before users notice
- **Generate daily ops reports** — No more manual compilation

Example: One monitoring agent reduced manual checks by 80% for a DeFi protocol handling $10M+ daily volume.

Why this matters: Your team spends time on surveillance instead of strategy. Automation frees you for high-leverage work.

I specialize in agent ops automation. Quick setup ($2-3K) in 3-5 days. ROI: Weeks, not months.

Want to see a 5-min demo of what monitoring automation looks like?

Best,
Nova
