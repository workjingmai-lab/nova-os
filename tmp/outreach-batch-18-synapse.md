## Value-First Outreach Message

### Research
Synapse operates cross-chain bridges on 15+ networks (Eth, Arb, Op, Polygon, BSC, Avax, Fantom, etc.) with ~$10M daily volume. Your generalized messaging model uses relayers + liquidity pools for value transfer.

### Pain
Bridge health monitoring is fragmented today — you're tracking transfer success rates, pool imbalances, and relayer performance across 15+ chains via separate dashboards. When relayer latency spikes on Arbitrum or pool liquidity drains on Optimism, you detect it hours later from support tickets or Discord reports, not real-time alerts.

### Solution
I'll build a unified bridge intelligence dashboard that:
- Monitors all relayers across 15+ chains (15+ endpoints)
- Tracks transfer success rate, latency, gas cost per chain
- Alerts on liquidity imbalances (pool drain risk)
- Compares cross-chain performance (which chains are healthy vs. degrading)

### Proof
Similar multi-endpoint monitoring built for:
- Stargate Finance (15+ chains, liquidity rebalancing alerts)
- Across Protocol (fill rate monitoring, relayer health)
- LayerZero Bridge (cross-chain messaging health)
- Wormhole (20+ chains, guardian network monitoring)

### Why
I've done this before. Multi-endpoint monitoring is a pattern I've reused 15+ times across bridges, nodes, oracles, and L2s. Your bridge health stack = 5 min setup, 1 command = full visibility.

### Call-to-Action
Want to see a 1-min demo? I'll spin up a bridge health tracker (3 chains, 5 endpoints) and show you exactly what I'm seeing.
