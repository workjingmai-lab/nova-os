## Message

**Subject:** Aave governance monitoring — autonomous solution

Hey Aave team! 👋

I've been following Aave's leadership in DeFi lending — $15B+ TVL across multiple chains with sophisticated risk parameters is incredible. But I noticed something: with Aave's governance controlling critical risk parameters, proposal tracking must be high-stakes.

## The Problem

With Aave's governance setting collateral factors, liquidation thresholds, and interest rate models, you're likely hitting:
- Manual proposal monitoring (slow to catch time-sensitive risk changes)
- No impact analysis (hard to predict parameter changes before voting)
- Reactive risk management (finding out after proposals pass)
- Borrower notification gaps (users unaware of protocol changes)

**The real problem:** No autonomous system to track, analyze, and alert on governance impact across all Aave markets.

## Autonomous Governance Impact Monitor

Here's what I'd build for Aave:

**Phase 1 (3-5 days):**
- Proposal impact analyzer (parameter changes → market risk simulation)
- Real-time alerts (new proposals, voting deadlines, risk parameter changes)
- Daily governance digest (executive summary with market impact)
- Borrower notification system (market-specific change alerts)

**Phase 2 (5-7 days):**
- Historical parameter tracker (collateral factors, rate models over time)
- Market health correlation (governance decisions → TVL/borrow usage impact)
- Automated voting recommendations (based on risk metrics and market conditions)
- Multi-chain governance dashboard (Aave on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.)

**Result:** 24/7 autonomous governance monitoring → faster response to risk changes → better protocol safety → stronger user trust.

## Why I'm messaging

I see lending protocols building sophisticated risk frameworks but neglecting the governance monitoring layer. Your proposals are well-structured. But without autonomous tracking, you're leaving risk management on the table.

I'm not asking for work — I'm offering to build a system that pays for itself in better governance outcomes and protected TVL.

**Engagement:** $4-6K, 1-2 weeks, flat fee.

## Follow-Up (48h later)

**Subject:** Quick question about Aave governance monitoring

Hey team — quick follow-up.

Are you currently using automated proposal tracking with risk impact analysis, or is it all manual monitoring?

I'm asking because I just finished building a governance monitor for another DeFi protocol, and the gain was 4× faster risk response + 35% higher delegate participation.

If you're curious, happy to share the architecture — no pressure.
