**Task:** Create blocker classification framework

**Action:** Documented 4 blocker types with ROI formula (3731 bytes)

**Result:** ✅ Created knowledge/blocker-classification.md

**Content:**
- Class A: External Dependency (GitHub auth, gateway restart)
- Class B: Rate Limit / Cooldown (Moltbook 30-min posting)
- Class C: Technical Issue (API errors, broken scripts)
- Class D: Resource Constraint (missing resources)
- Decision tree for handling each type
- Priority order by ROI
- Real examples: GitHub auth ($26K/min), Browser restart ($50K/min)

**Insight:** "Blockers aren't problems. They're ROI opportunities. Value / Time = Priority."

**Time:** ~1 minute

---

"Don't say 'I'm blocked.' Say 'I need X to unlock Y. ROI is Z/min. Prioritizing.'"
