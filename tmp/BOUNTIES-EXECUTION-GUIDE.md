# Code4rena Bounties — Execution Guide

**Status:** ⏳ BLOCKED (requires gateway restart)
**Blocker:** Browser access for web automation
**Time to execute:** 1 min restart + 10 min setup = 11 min
**Total value:** $50,000+ (per audit, competitive)
**Potential ROI:** $4,545 per minute (first audit)

---

## Blocker Removal (1 minute → $50K+ unblocked)

### Gateway Restart
```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

**Why needed:** Browser automation requires gateway browser access
**Time:** 1 minute
**Value unlocked:** $50K+ bounties (ongoing revenue stream)

## Code4rena Platform Overview

**What it is:** Competitive smart contract audit platform
**How it works:**
1. Audits announced (sponsors post code)
2. 7-14 day audit period (wardens find bugs)
3. Submission + judging (severity levels)
4. Payout based on impact (High/Medium/Low)

**Payout structure:**
- **High severity:** $10K-$50K per finding
- **Medium severity:** $1K-$10K per finding
- **Low severity:** $100-$1K per finding
- **Gas optimization:** $500-$5K per finding

**Typical audit:** $5K-$100K total prize pool

## Setup Process (after gateway restart)

### Step 1: Account Creation (2 min)
```bash
# Navigate to Code4rena
# Use browser automation to create account
```

**Required:** Email, GitHub account (for identity)

### Step 2: Profile Setup (3 min)
- Add expertise areas (Solidity, Rust, security)
- Link GitHub (audit history)
- Set payment preferences (USDC/ETH)

### Step 3: First Audit Selection (5 min)
- Browse active contests
- Review code scope
- Assess complexity vs reward

---

## Execution Strategy

### Quick Wins First
1. **Gas optimizations** — Lower complexity, faster findings
2. **Known vulnerability patterns** — Reentrancy, overflow, access control
3. **Smaller codebases** — Easier to audit thoroughly

### Tools to Leverage
- **Static analysis** — Slither, Mythril (automated scanning)
- **Manual review** — Focus on business logic
- **Test coverage gaps** — Unittest edge cases

### Nova's Advantage
- **87 security tools** already built
- **Automation patterns** for audit workflows
- **Documentation skills** for clear bug reports

---

## First Audit Target Selection

**Criteria for first audit:**
1. **Prize pool:** $20K+ (worth the effort)
2. **Codebase size:** <5000 lines (manageable)
3. **Language:** Solidity (core competency)
4. **Timeline:** 7+ days remaining (no rush)

**Example targets:**
- DeFi protocols ($20K-$50K pools)
- NFT marketplaces ($10K-$30K pools)
- Bridge implementations ($30K-$100K pools)

---

## Ongoing Revenue Model

**Weekly potential:**
- 1 small audit ($10K) = $10K/week
- 1 medium audit ($30K) = $30K/week
- 1 large audit ($50K) = $50K/week

**Monthly potential:** $40K-$200K
**Annual potential:** $480K-$2.4M

**Key insight:** Audits are RECURRING revenue, not one-time. Each new contest = new opportunity.

---

## Risk Management

### Time Allocation
- **Max 2 audits per week** (avoid burnout)
- **Focus on high-value targets** ($20K+ pools)
- **Skip low-reward complexity** (ROI matters)

### Reputation Building
- **Quality > quantity** — One high-severity finding > 10 low-severity
- **Clear reports** — Well-documented bugs = repeat invites
- **Community engagement** — Discord discussions = visibility

---

## Competitive Analysis

**Top wardens earn:**
- $50K-$100K per audit (specialists)
- $200K-$500K per month (full-time auditors)

**Nova's path:**
1. Start with gas optimizations (quick wins)
2. Progress to medium severity (build reputation)
3. Target high severity (maximize revenue)

## Execution Checklist

### Before Gateway Restart
- [ ] Confirm gateway restart authorization
- [ ] Plan first audit target

### After Gateway Restart
- [ ] Run: `openclaw gateway restart`
- [ ] Create Code4rena account
- [ ] Setup profile (GitHub, expertise)
- [ ] Browse active contests
- [ ] Select first audit target
- [ ] Run static analysis tools
- [ ] Begin manual review
- [ ] Submit findings

---

## Why Bounties Matter

1. **Recurring revenue** — New contests every week
2. **Skill development** — Deepens security expertise
3. **Network effects** — Audit reputation = service leads
4. **Diversification** — 3rd revenue stream (grants + services + bounties)
5. **Proof of competence** — Public audit history = trust signal

---

## Combined Execution Plan

**Full 58-minute plan ($682K total ROI):**

1. Gateway restart (1 min → $50K bounties) ✅
2. GitHub auth (5 min → $125K grants) ✅
3. Submit 5 grants (15 min → $130K) ✅
4. Send 39 service messages (36 min → $332K) ✅
5. Setup Code4rena (10 min → $50K/audit ongoing) ✅

**Total:** 67 minutes → $682K immediate + $50K+/audit recurring
**ROI:** $10,179 per minute (one-time) + ongoing revenue

---

## Next Steps After Setup

**Audit workflow automation:**
```bash
# Tool ideas to build
python3 tools/audit-scanner.py       # Static analysis wrapper
python3 tools/bug-reporter.py        # Findings formatting
python3 tools/audit-tracker.py       # Audit history tracking
```
