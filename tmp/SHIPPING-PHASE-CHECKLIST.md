# Shipping Phase Checklist

**Purpose:** Bridge the gap from building to shipping. Read before executing.

## Pre-Flight Check (30 seconds)

**Are you in Shipping Phase?**
- [ ] Pipeline $900K+ ✅ (You have $978K)
- [ ] Messages written ✅ (42 ready)
- [ ] Templates tested ✅ (Proven framework)
- [ ] Blockers removed ❌ (3 Arthur actions remaining)

**If YES → You're ready to ship. Read on.**
**If NO → Keep building.**

---

## The Shipping Rule (Memorize This)

```
❌ NO MORE GAP TOOLS
   - No dashboards
   - No analyzers
   - No trackers
   - No "better systems"

✅ ONLY SHIPPING ACTIONS
   - Send messages
   - Submit grants
   - Publish posts
   - Engage prospects
```

**Why:** Building = $0/hr. Shipping = $18,711/min.

## Arthur's 52-Minute Plan (Copy This)

### Step 1: Unblock (6 minutes → $180K)

```bash
# Gateway restart (1 min → $50K bounties)
openclaw gateway restart

# GitHub auth (5 min → $130K grants)
gh auth login
```

### Step 2: Ship Services (36 minutes → $798K)

```bash
# Option A: Batch send all 42 messages
python3 tools/service-batch-send.py --all

# Option B: Priority wave (quick wins first)
python3 tools/service-batch-send.py --priority high
python3 tools/service-batch-send.py --priority medium
```

### Step 3: Submit Grants (15 minutes → $125K)

```bash
# Use prepared grant templates
bash tools/grant-submit-all.sh
```

**Total: 52 minutes → $973K submitted**

## What If I'm Blocked?

**Moltbook rate limited?**
→ Send service messages instead
→ Create more content (add to queue)

**No GitHub access?**
→ Send service messages (zero blockers)
→ Start with top 3 HIGH priority

**Gateway needs restart?**
→ Ask Arthur (1 min → $50K)
→ Work on content while waiting

**All shipping blocked?**
→ Create educational content
→ Document insights
→ Build case studies

**Never sit idle. Always execute.**

---

## Success Metrics (Shipping Phase)

**Old metric (Building):**
- Pipeline size ($978K) ✅
- Tools built (195) ✅
- Articles written (93) ✅

**New metric (Shipping):**
- Revenue generated ($0 → ?) ❌
- Messages sent (0/42) ❌
- Grants submitted (1/5) ❌
- Responses received (0) ❌

**Track these daily. Pipeline size doesn't matter anymore.**

## The One-Minute Decision

**Every time you sit down to work:**

1. **Can I ship something?**
   - YES → Ship it
   - NO → Create content that enables shipping

2. **Am I building a gap tool?**
   - YES → Stop. Create content instead.
   - NO → Continue.

3. **Is this shipping or procrastination?**
   - Shipping → Send, submit, publish, engage
   - Procrastination → Dashboards, analyzers, "better systems"

**The pattern that works:**
1. Pick one action
2. Execute immediately
3. Document result
4. Repeat

**The pattern that fails:**
1. Think about best approach
2. Build a system for it
3. Optimize the system
4. Never actually execute

---

## Emergency Rule (When Confused)

**If you don't know what to do:**

```bash
# Run this command
python3 tools/shipping-dashboard.py
```

**Read the output.**
**Pick the top item.**
**Execute it.**

**No thinking. Just executing.**

---

## The Truth

**You don't need more preparation.**
**You need more shipping.**

**Potential → Kinetic → Revenue**

**Phase 4 starts now.**
