[WORK BLOCK 1326 — 2026-02-04T01:35Z] Analytics consolidation complete. Created diary_parser.py (7,571 bytes) + analytics.py (6,114 bytes) + README (3,243 bytes) = 16,928 bytes total. Consolidated 4 tools (tool-usage-analysis, work-pattern-analyzer, velocity-predictor, daily-output-tracker) into 1 unified CLI with 4 subcommands. Savings: ~18% code reduction, shared parsing logic. Tested: All commands work. Note: Only 2 blocks in diary.md today (historical data in memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md files). Benefits: Code reduction, consistency, maintainability, extensibility, no breaking changes. Old tools still work. Small executions compound.
