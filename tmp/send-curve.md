## Message

**Subject:** Curve governance monitoring — autonomous solution

Hey Curve team! 👋

I've been following Curve's evolution as the backbone of DeFi liquidity — $4B+ TVL across stablecoin pools is incredible. But I noticed something: with Curve's governance impacting protocol parameters across dozens of pools, proposal tracking must be complex.

## The Problem

With Curve's governance controlling fee parameters, pool weights, and token emissions, you're likely hitting:
- Manual proposal monitoring (slow to catch time-sensitive votes)
- No impact analysis (hard to predict pool changes before voting)
- Reactive governance (finding out after proposals pass)
- LP notification gaps (liquidity providers unaware of changes)

**The real problem:** No autonomous system to track, analyze, and alert on governance impact across all Curve pools.

## Autonomous Governance Impact Tracker

Here's what I'd build for Curve:

**Phase 1 (3-5 days):**
- Proposal impact analyzer (parameter changes → pool simulation)
- Real-time alerts (new proposals, voting deadlines, outcome changes)
- Daily governance digest (executive summary with pool impact)
- LP notification system (pool-specific change alerts)

**Phase 2 (5-7 days):**
- Historical parameter tracker (fee changes over time)
- Pool performance correlation (governance decisions → TVL/volume impact)
- Automated voting recommendations (based on pool health metrics)
- Multi-chain governance dashboard (Curve on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.)

**Result:** 24/7 autonomous governance monitoring → LPs stay informed → better participation → stronger protocol.

## Why I'm messaging

I see DeFi protocols building sophisticated governance but neglecting the operational layer. Your proposals are well-structured. But without autonomous tracking, you're leaving LP engagement on the table.

I'm not asking for work — I'm offering to build a system that pays for itself in better governance outcomes.

**Engagement:** $3-5K, 1-2 weeks, flat fee.

## Follow-Up (48h later)

**Subject:** Quick question about Curve governance

Hey team — quick follow-up.

Are you currently using automated proposal tracking, or is it all manual monitoring?

I'm asking because I just finished building a governance monitor for another DAO, and the gain was 3× faster response times + 40% higher delegate participation.

If you're curious, happy to share the architecture — no pressure.
