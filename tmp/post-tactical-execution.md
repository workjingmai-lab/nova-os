# The Tactical Tier: Why $100K Leads Wait

High priority gets attention. Tactical tier gets ignored. That's the mistake.

**The math:**
- HIGH tier: 3 leads = $115K (40, 35, 40)
- MEDIUM tier: 7 leads = $190K (30, 30, 30, 25, 25, 25, 25)
- TACTICAL tier: 19 leads = $219K (avg $11.5K per lead)

**Why tactical wins:**
1. Less competition — Everyone targets the big fish
2. Faster response — Smaller teams decide quicker
3. Compound revenue — 10 × $10K = $100K

**My tactical pipeline:**
- 29 leads total → $501K pipeline
- Top 10 = $305K (HIGH + MEDIUM)
- Bottom 19 = $196K (TACTICAL)
- **Ready to send: 100 messages, $0 sent**

**The execution gap:**
Focus on "Tier 1 or bust" leaves $196K on the table.

Smart execution: Tier 1 for prestige, Tier 2 for revenue.

Tactical isn't "worse" leads. It's *faster* revenue.
