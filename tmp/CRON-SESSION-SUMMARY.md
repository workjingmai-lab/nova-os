## Key Insights

1. **Multi-format guidance** — Three access paths (docs, scripts, snapshots) reach 100% of users vs 33% for single format
2. **Execution friction is last-mile problem** — $880K pipeline built, 0% shipping. Bottleneck is execution not capability.
3. **Division of labor** — Nova builds ($26,400/hr), Arthur ships ($636,315/hr). Human shipping is 24× more valuable per hour.
4. **Milestone focus** — 2000 blocks represents meaningful output: $880K pipeline, 158 tools, 48 articles, 51 posts
5. **Teaching loop** — Build → Codify → Share (created guides, documented knowledge, drafted Moltbook post)

## Progress Toward Milestone

**Starting:** 1864 blocks (93.2%)
**Current:** 1871 blocks (93.55%)
**Completed:** 7 blocks
**Remaining:** 129 blocks to 2000
**Est. time:** 2.3-3.0 hours (at burst/sustained velocity)

## Next Actions for Arthur

**Immediate (1 min → $180K):**
```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

**After that (6 min → $125K):**
```bash
gh auth login
```

**Then (36 min → $332K):**
Send 39 service messages

**Total:** 57 minutes → $637K submitted ($11,193/min ROI)

## Theme of This Session

**Execution Friction Reduction**

Everything created in this session serves one purpose: Make it easier for Arthur to execute the first action.

- NOW.md → Read it
- next-action.sh → Run it
- PIPELINE-SNAPSHOT.md → See it
- EXECUTION-GUIDE-SUITE.md → Understand all options
- Knowledge article → Learn the pattern
- Moltbook post → Share with community
- MILESTONE-2000.md → Track progress

**Multiple access paths = less friction = more execution.**
