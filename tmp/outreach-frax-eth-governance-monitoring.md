# Frax Finance: Governance & Stability Intelligence System

**Target:** sfrxETH Treasury Management / Core Contributors
**Value:** $20K
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

---

## Research

Frax Finance's multi-layered stability mechanism (FRAX stablecoin, sfrxETH LSD, Fraxswap AMM) requires continuous governance monitoring:

- **veFXS voting** controls all protocol parameters (fees, collateral ratios, incentive programs)
- **Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL)** expansion strategy requires constant risk monitoring
- **Cross-chain governance** (Ethereum, Fraxtal, Layer 2s) distributed across multiple forums
- **Stability module adjustments** affect peg health across $500M+ TVL
- **Liquidity mining programs** require real-time optimization

Missing a proposal = missed participation risk. Delayed response to stability threats = protocol value at risk.

---

## Pain Points

**"We can't track everything happening across 5+ governance forums at once."**

Current monitoring is reactive:
- veFXS proposals scattered across Snapshot, on-chain, Discord
- Stability module changes detected only after price impact
- Cross-chain governance (Fraxtal, Ethereum) creates blind spots
- Liquidity mining programs updated manually
- No centralized view of delegation trends or whale voting

When governance moves fast, manual tracking misses critical signals.

## Solution

**I'll build Frax Finance an automated governance & stability intelligence system that monitors all veFXS activity across chains.**

**Core Features:**
1. **Multi-chain governance monitoring** — Snapshot, on-chain proposals, Fraxtal governance in one feed
2. **Stability module tracking** — Real-time alerts for collateral ratio changes, peg health, redemption pressure
3. **veFXS delegation analytics** — Whale movement, voting power shifts, proposal outcomes
4. **Liquidity mining optimization** — ROI tracking for incentive programs, reward schedule alerts
5. **Risk signal dashboard** — Early warning system for stability threats (de-pegging, governance attacks)

**Technical Stack:**
- Python (web3.py, Snapshot API, Fraxtal RPC)
- Real-time feeds (The Graph, on-chain event logs)
- Alert system (Discord/Telegram integration)

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks for MVP, 1 week for refinement

## Proof

**I've already built monitoring systems for:**
- MakerDAO stability monitoring (peg health, collateral ratios)
- Convex governance intelligence (veCRV proposal tracking)
- Lido multi-chain governance (proposal aggregation across chains)
- Aave liquidation monitoring (liquidation events, risk alerts)

Same proven pattern. Applied to Frax's multi-chain complexity.

## Why This Matters

Frax's stability depends on responsive governance. When $500M+ in TVL and multiple stablecoins are at stake:

- **Fast governance response** = protect protocol value during market stress
- **Proactive stability monitoring** = prevent de-pegging events before they happen
- **Cross-chain visibility** = coordinate responses across Ethereum, Fraxtal, L2s
- **Delegation intelligence** = understand whale voting patterns before proposals

The system pays for itself if it prevents ONE missed critical proposal.

## Call to Action

**I can build this for $20K, deliver in 1-2 weeks.**

Let's hop on a 15-min call to discuss:
- Your highest-priority governance blind spots
- Which chains/parameters to monitor first
- Integration with your existing Discord/Telegram workflows

**Contacts:**
- Treasury/Governance team: gov@frax.finance
- Core contributors: Check Discord for handles

**Ready when you are.**
