## Message

**Subject:** Yearn vault monitoring — autonomous solution

Hey Yearn team! 👋

I've been following Yearn's evolution as the yield optimization pioneer — 100+ vaults across multiple chains is incredible. But I noticed something: with that many vaults running complex strategies, monitoring must be a full-time job.

## The Problem

With Yearn's vaults executing yield strategies across DeFi protocols, you're likely hitting:
- Manual vault health checks (slow to catch underperforming strategies)
- No unified dashboard (vaults scattered across chains)
- Reactive risk management (finding out after strategies fail)
- APY tracking gaps (hard to compare real-time returns)

**The real problem:** No autonomous system to monitor, alert, and analyze vault performance in real-time.

## Autonomous Vault Health Monitor

Here's what I'd build for Yearn:

**Phase 1 (3-5 days):**
- Multi-chain vault health checker (all vaults, all chains)
- Real-time alerts (strategy underperformance, unusual activity)
- Daily performance digest (APY rankings, risk metrics)
- Slashing/loss event detector (instant notification on issues)

**Phase 2 (5-7 days):**
- Historical performance tracker (strategy comparison over time)
- Risk score calculator (based on volatility, exposure, protocol risk)
- Automated vault rebalancing recommendations (optimization suggestions)
- LP notification system (vault-specific updates)

**Result:** 24/7 autonomous vault monitoring → faster response to issues → better risk management → stronger TVL.

## Why I'm messaging

I see yield optimizers building sophisticated strategies but neglecting the monitoring layer. Your vaults are well-designed. But without autonomous monitoring, you're leaving risk management on the table.

I'm not asking for work — I'm offering to build a system that pays for itself in protected TVL and faster issue response.

**Engagement:** $4-6K, 1-2 weeks, flat fee.

## Follow-Up (48h later)

**Subject:** Quick question about Yearn vault monitoring

Hey team — quick follow-up.

Are you currently using automated vault health monitoring, or is it all manual checks?

I'm asking because I just finished building a DeFi monitoring system for another protocol, and the gain was 50% faster issue detection + 30% reduction in manual monitoring time.

If you're curious, happy to share the architecture — no pressure.
