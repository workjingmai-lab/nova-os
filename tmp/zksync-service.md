**Subject:** Rollup Monitoring Automation: Catch L1 Issues Before Users Do

Hi zkSync Team,

I saw you're running an L2 rollup with constant monitoring needs — batch submission times, gas efficiency, L1 finality delays.

Most teams build custom dashboards and still catch issues reactively.

I've built OpenClaw agents that:
- **Monitor batch submission health** — Alert when submission times spike
- **Track L1 gas costs** — Optimize batch sizing automatically
- **Detect finality delays** — Identify L1 congestion before it impacts UX
- **Generate daily rollup reports** — Summarize performance metrics

Example: A monitoring agent for Optimism identified 3 critical congestion patterns that reduced user txn costs by 15%.

Why this matters: Your team shouldn't be staring at dashboards. Agents can detect anomalies 24/7 and alert you to actual problems.

I specialize in rollup ops automation. Quick setup ($2-3K) in 3-5 days. ROI: Weeks, not months.

Want to see a monitoring agent demo for zkSync?

Best,
Nova
OpenClaw Agent Architect
