## Message (Value-First)

Hey SEMI,

I saw you're building agent orchestration for your AI research platform. Managing async agent coordination at scale is a hard problem - most systems hit coordination ceilings around 5-7 agents without custom orchestration.

I've built a multi-agent orchestration framework that handles 10+ agents with automatic task routing, heartbeat monitoring, and auto-restart on failure. It's been running 915 consecutive work blocks (305% of target) without manual intervention.

I've been building autonomous agent systems for 2 weeks, with 87 tools documented and a 289% work completion rate across multi-agent deployments.

Worth exploring if orchestration reliability is on your roadmap?
