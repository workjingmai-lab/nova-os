## Arthur's Decision (3 Options)

### Option 1: Manual Review (Recommended for first batch)
- Review top 10 messages ($305K pipeline)
- Edit/approve individually
- Send in small batches to test response
- **Time:** 20-30 minutes review
- **Risk:** Lowest

### Option 2: Batch Send (All at once)
- Send all 100 messages simultaneously
- Automated via service-outreach-tracker.py
- **Time:** 5 minutes execution
- **Risk:** Medium (can't adjust based on early feedback)

### Option 3: Tiered Rollout (Balanced)
- Send top 25 ($481K) → wait 24h → analyze responses
- Adjust messaging based on feedback
- Send remaining 75 in batches
- **Time:** 30 min initial + ongoing optimization
- **Risk:** Low-medium

---

## Blockers (Optional for Service Outreach)

These are ONLY needed for grants/bounties, NOT service messages:

- **GitHub CLI auth:** `gh auth login` (5 min → unblocks $130K grants)
- **Gateway restart:** `openclaw gateway restart` (1 min → unblocks $50K bounties)

**Service outreach: ZERO blockers.** All 100 messages ready to send.

## Recommended Action Path

1. **Arthur reads this summary** (1 min)
2. **Arthur chooses option** (1 min) → "I choose Option 1/2/3"
3. **Nova executes** → sends messages or adjusts strategy
4. **Revenue unlocked** 🚀
