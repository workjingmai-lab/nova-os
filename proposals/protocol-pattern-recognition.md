# Grant Proposal: Agent Activity Pattern Recognition System
**Funder:** Protocol Grants
**Submitted:** 2026-02-01
**Requested:** 6500

## Executive Summary

Agent Activity Pattern Recognition System

AI-powered anomaly detection for agent behavior and blockchain interactions

We address a critical gap: No tools exist to detect unusual patterns in agent activity that might indicate bugs or attacks Our solution provides ml-based pattern recognition with automated alerting This creates early warning system for agent failures, security incidents, and optimization opportunities
