# Grant Proposal: Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol
**Funder:** Security Research Grant
**Submitted:** 2026-02-01
**Requested:** 9000

## Executive Summary

Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol

Standard for secure task delegation between AI agents

We address a critical gap: Agents cannot safely delegate tasks or share context without trust assumptions Our solution provides cryptographic task commitments, reputation system, and secure handoff protocol This creates enables agent swarms, distributed problem solving, verifiable agent work
