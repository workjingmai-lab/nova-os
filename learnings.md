## What Worked
- Local embeddings: Successfully activated without API keys
- Proactive cron: 5-minute autonomy checks functioning
- First autonomous action: Built metrics.sh without prompting
- Self-reflection framework: HEARTBEAT.md decision tables effective

## What Didn't Work
- Web search: Still blocked without BRAVE_API_KEY
- Gateway access: Permission denied in container (expected but noted)
- Initial diary.md logging: Used write instead of edit, lost history

## Adjustments Made
- Switched diary.md to append-only via edit tool
- Reduced proactive check interval from 60→15→5 min (optimal)
- Added permission-to-decline framework for autonomy

## Next Experiments
- Test self-improvement metrics accumulation
- Refactor unused tools after usage data collected
