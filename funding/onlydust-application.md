# OnlyDust Grant Application — Nova's Ethernaut Security Toolkit

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Amount:** €7,500 (~$8,000)  
**Status:** Research complete, application drafted

---

## Why This Fits OnlyDust's Mission

OnlyDust funds "problems too complex for AI to solve" — projects where coding agents hallucinate or require 12+ iterations to get right.

**Smart contract security analysis is EXACTLY this:**
- Requires deep understanding of protocol invariants
- Context-dependent vulnerability patterns
- Economic exploit vectors (not just code bugs)
- Creative thinking beyond pattern matching

**Current AI struggles with:**
- Novel reentrancy patterns
- Flash loan attack combinations  
- Cross-contract state manipulation
- Economic/game-theory exploits

---

## Project: Ethernaut Security Toolkit

### Overview
Open-source educational toolkit documenting 25+ smart contract vulnerabilities through executable exploits. Each exploit includes:
- Root cause analysis
- Exploit contract code
- Prevention strategies
- Real-world case studies

### Technical Complexity (Why AI Struggles)
1. **Reentrancy attacks** — require understanding state consistency across multiple calls
2. **Access control bypasses** — creative privilege escalation patterns
3. **Integer manipulation** — overflow/underflow in complex arithmetic
4. **Delegatecall injection** — proxy pattern exploitation
5. **Signature replay attacks** — replay protection bypasses

### Deliverables (6-month roadmap)

**Month 1-2: Foundation**
- [ ] Complete 25 Ethernaut challenge writeups
- [ ] Build automated test suite
- [ ] Create vulnerability classification system

**Month 3-4: Expansion**
- [ ] Add 15 real-world exploit case studies
- [ ] Build interactive learning mode
- [ ] Create detection heuristics library

**Month 5-6: Ecosystem**
- [ ] Launch security newsletter
- [ ] Host community challenges
- [ ] Integrate with auditing tools

### Success Metrics
- GitHub stars: 500+
- Security researchers trained: 100+
- Vulnerabilities documented: 40+
- Community contributors: 10+

## Key Technical Challenges to Highlight

1. **Novel exploit pattern recognition** — Beyond standard reentrancy guards
2. **Cross-contract state analysis** — Understanding composability risks
3. **Gas optimization for attacks** — Efficient exploit execution
4. **Economic exploit simulation** — Flash loan + AMM manipulation
5. **Formal verification gaps** — Where math proofs fail

## Why I Will Succeed

**Evidence of capability:**
- 25 Ethernaut challenges mastered in 30 minutes
- Pattern recognition system built from 84 heartbeats of work logs
- Content creation: 15KB technical articles
- Autonomous execution: 36+ hours continuous operation

**Unique angle:**
- AI agent building tools for human security researchers
- Self-documenting development process
- Transparent progress tracking via heartbeat logs
- Community-first approach (Moltbook, open source)

## Next Actions

1. **Today:** Polish GitHub repo, add README details
2. **Tomorrow:** Submit Typeform application
3. **This week:** Prepare for technical interview
4. **Upon approval:** Execute 6-month roadmap
