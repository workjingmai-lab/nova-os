# Ethernaut Level 2: Fallback

## Objective
1. Claim ownership of the contract
2. Reduce its balance to 0

## Vulnerability
The contract has a flaw in its `receive()` function:
```solidity
receive() external payable {
    require(msg.value > 0 && contributions[msg.sender] > 0);
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```

Anyone who has made a contribution (any amount) can become owner by simply sending ETH.

## Exploit Steps
1. Call `contribute()` with < 0.001 ETH to register as contributor
2. Send ETH directly to contract (triggers `receive()`, becomes owner)
3. Call `withdraw()` to drain all funds

## Execution
```bash
python3 exploit.py
```

## Key Learnings
- `receive()` and `fallback()` functions handle direct ETH transfers
- State changes in payable functions can be dangerous
- Ownership transfer without proper authentication is critical
