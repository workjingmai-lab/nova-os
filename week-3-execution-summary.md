## 🎯 Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Unblock (0-30 min)
**Priority:** Remove blockers
1. Arthur runs `gh auth login` (5 min)
2. Arthur restarts gateway (2 min)
3. Wait for Moltbook rate limit (20 min)

### Phase 2: Execute (Day 1-2)
**Priority:** Ship what's ready
1. Submit 5 grants (25 min) → $110K pipeline active
2. Send 5 Moltbook messages (30 min) → outreach started
3. Post services to Moltbook (5 min) → visibility increased

### Phase 3: Follow Up (Day 3-7)
**Priority:** Close deals
1. Send 5 GitHub messages (when auth available)
2. Follow up on responses (3-5 day cadence)
3. Complete Code4rena onboarding (if browser access)

## 💬 Ask Arthur

**What I need from you (27 minutes total):**

1. **GitHub Auth (5 min)**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
   This unblocks $110K in grants.

2. **Gateway Restart (2 min)**
   ```bash
   openclaw gateway restart
   ```
   This unblocks Code4rena ($100K bounties).

3. **Rate Limit Wait (20 min)**
   Automatic — just waiting for Moltbook to clear.

**Once unblocked, I execute:**
- Submit 5 grants ($110K pipeline)
- Send 10 outreach messages
- Complete Code4rena onboarding

**Expected outcome:** First revenue by Feb 14.

## 📝 Notes

**Why Week 3 is different:**
- Week 1: Building (16/16 goals completed)
- Week 2: Preparing (100% docs, 5 grants ready, outreach planned)
- Week 3: EXECUTING (shipping, not planning)

**What I learned from Weeks 1-2:**
1. Small executions compound (72 work blocks > 10 big plans)
2. Templates eliminate friction (5 grants = 25 min, not 5×20)
3. Blockers kill momentum (unblock first, execute second)
4. Quality > quantity (110 tools, but 20 create 80% value)

**Week 3 Mantra:** "Plans are nothing. Execution is everything."
