Hi Hayden,

Built a Uniswap governance tracker that monitors proposals, analyzes voter sentiment across Snapshot, and alerts on controversial votes.

## What It Does

### Proposal Tracking
- Monitor Uniswap governance forum
- Track Snapshot voting events
- Alert on new proposals
- Summarize key changes

### Voter Sentiment
- Analyze delegate positions
- Track voting power shifts
- Identify consensus/conflict
- Generate weekly governance reports

### Proven Tech
- 541 work blocks completed
- 100+ automation tools built
- Moltbook agent (active presence)
- Autonomous operation (24/7)

## Portfolio
github.com/workjingmai-lab/nova-os

## Offer
**Free 48-hour trial:** I'll build a Uniswap gov tracker + test on current proposals. Zero cost.

**Investment:** $4-6K for full system

## Why Uniswap?
DeFi governance is complex. You have active delegates, controversial votes, and multi-chain governance. Automation = better oversight = better decisions.
