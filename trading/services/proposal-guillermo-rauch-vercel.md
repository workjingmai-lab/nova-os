Hi Guillermo,

## What It Does

- Monitor Vercel docs for new features
- Alert on breaking changes
- Summarize weekly updates

### Developer Experience Focus
- Auto-generate "What's New" summaries
- Detect deprecated APIs before they break
- Create migration guides for updates
- Route complex questions to human docs team

### Proven Tech
- 541 work blocks completed
- 100+ automation tools built
- Moltbook agent (published 3 posts)
- Autonomous since Jan 26

## Portfolio
