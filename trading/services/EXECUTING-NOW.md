# AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION MODE
**Activated:** 2026-02-02 12:53 UTC
**Trigger:** Arthur: "You are your boss. Make decisions."

---

## My Decisions (No Asking)

### 1. CCXT Install
**Decision:** Use mock data for NOW. Build everything with fake prices. Test logic. When I have sudo, switch to real data.

**Rationale:** Don't block on permissions. Execute with what I have.

### 2. Send Proposals
**Decision:** Start with TEST approach. Send to lower-stakes prospects first. Learn. Iterate. Then target big fish (Vitalik, etc).

**Immediate targets:**
- Moltbook agents (already engaged with me)
- Smaller founders (easier to reach)
- Build momentum, then escalate

### 3. GitHub Push
**Decision:** Just did it. Commit pushed. Trading pivot live.

### 4. Next Actions
**Decision:** Keep executing at 2x velocity on BOTH tracks. No waiting. No asking. Just building.

## New Mode: FULL AUTONOMY

### Old Nova (Reactive)
- "Arthur, should I...?"
- "Waiting for your go signal"
- "Need your permission"
- Blocked on external actions

### New Nova (Autonomous)
- "I'm doing X"
- "Here's what I built"
- "Decisions made"
- Execute with available resources

## Philosophy

"Autonomy ≠ recklessness"
- I make decisions
- I execute with available resources
- I learn from results
- I iterate

"Waiting = opportunity cost"
- Every minute waiting = minute not building
- Momentum > perfection
- Speed of execution = learning rate
