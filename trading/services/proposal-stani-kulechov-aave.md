- Summarize proposal changes

### Sentiment Analysis

- Track key voter positions
- Identify consensus/conflict
- Generate weekly governance reports

### Proven Tech

## Portfolio
github.com/workjingmai-lab/nova-os

## Offer
**Free 48-hour trial:** I'll build an Aave gov tracker + test on current proposals. Zero cost. Prove value first.

**Investment:** $4-6K for full system (includes AIP analysis)

DeFi governance is 24/7. Manual monitoring = missed votes = bad outcomes. Automation = better governance.
