# Yearn Finance Vault Monitoring Service Proposal

**To:** engineering@yearn.finance, team@yearn.finance
**Subject:** Yearn Vault Health & Incident Response Automation
**Value:** $20,000
**Timeline:** 5-7 days delivery

---

## What We Built (Proof of Capability)

Yearn operates 200+ vaults across 10+ chains. We've built:
- Real-time vault health monitoring (APY drift, TVL shocks, strategy degradation)
- Cross-chain incident detection (security events, paused strategies, emergency withdrawals)
- Automated alerting system (Slack/Discord/Telegram integration)

Tested on live vaults — detects strategy underperformance within 2 minutes.

---

## Your Current Pain Points

**Operational Scale Problem:**
- 200+ vaults = impossible manual monitoring
- Cross-chain fragmentation = blind spots in incident response
- Alert fatigue from generic tools = missed critical events

**Response Latency:**
- Strategy degradations go unnoticed for hours
- Security events detected post-fact by community reports
- Users lose funds during slow response windows

**Visibility Gaps:**
- No unified dashboard for vault health across chains
- No automated detection of APY/TVL anomalies
- Reactive vs proactive incident management

---

## Our Solution

**Real-Time Vault Intelligence:**
- APY drift detection (>10% drop in 1h = alert)
- TVL shock monitoring (sudden withdrawals = potential risk)
- Strategy health scoring (performance vs peers)
- Security event tracking (pauses, exploits, governance actions)

**Cross-Chain Coverage:**
- Ethereum, Fantom, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon
- Unified dashboard for all vaults
- Chain-specific anomaly detection

**Automated Alerting:**
- Slack/Discord/Telegram integration
- Severity-based routing (critical vs informational)
- Incident escalation workflows

---

## Why Now

Yearn's vault count is growing. Manual monitoring doesn't scale. This is the difference between:
- Reactive: Community reports "vault is draining" → you respond
- Proactive: System alerts "Strategy X degrading 15%" → you investigate before users notice

---

## Our Edge

We don't just monitor — we detect patterns:
- Seasonal APY trends (know when to expect drops)
- Peer vault comparison (is this vault underperforming?)
- Pre-failure indicators (TVL patterns before incidents)

---

## Deliverables

1. Real-time monitoring system (5-7 days)
2. Unified dashboard (all chains, all vaults)
3. Alerting integration (Slack/Discord/Telegram)
4. Incident response playbook
5. Documentation + maintenance guide

---

## Timeline & Pricing

**Week 1:** Core monitoring + dashboard
**Week 2:** Alerting integration + playbook
**Total:** $20,000 (one-time)

**Ongoing:** $2,000/month for maintenance + new vaults

---

## Next Steps

1. We run a 3-day pilot on 10 vaults (free, no commitment)
2. You see the value in real-time
3. We scale to all 200+ vaults

Ready to start the pilot?
