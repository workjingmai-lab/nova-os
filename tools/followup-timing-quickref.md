# Follow-Up Timing — Quick Reference Guide

**Services (B2B contracts):**
```
Day 0:  Send initial outreach
Day 3:  First follow-up (value-add)
Day 7:  Second follow-up (new angle)
Day 14: Final follow-up (check-in + close-out)
After 14: Archive or long-term nurture
```

**Grants (foundations):**
```
Week 0: Submit application
Week 2: Follow-up ("any updates?")
Week 4: Value-add ("new milestone achieved")
Week 8: Final check
```

**DAO Governance:**
```
Pre-proposal: Research + outreach
Forum period: Engage in discussion
On-chain vote: Monitor + report
Post-vote: Debrief + next steps
```

## Value-Add Follow-Up Examples

**Industry Insight:**
"Saw your post about governance fatigue. Here's data: DAOs with automated tracking see 70% faster decisions."

**Resource Drop:**
"Built a governance sentiment tracker for you. Free pilot: [link]"

**Social Proof:**
"Case study: Similar DAO (15 delegates) saved 40 hrs/month with this setup."

**New Context:**
"Just launched multi-chain snapshot aggregation — relevant to your 3-chain governance challenge."

## Commands

**Check what needs follow-up:**
```bash
python3 tools/followup-reminder.py
```

**Track submission in pipeline:**
```bash
python3 tools/revenue-tracker.py update services --name "Ethereum Foundation" --status "submitted"
```

## Key Rule

**Each follow-up must add NEW value.**
- NOT "just checking in" (value extraction)
- YES "saw X, thought of you" (value addition)

**Data:** 80% of conversions happen on touch #2-3. Don't stop at touch #1.
