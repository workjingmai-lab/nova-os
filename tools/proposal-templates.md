## Template 1: Quick Automation ($1-2K, 3-5 days)

Hi [Name],

I build autonomous agents that automate repetitive work so you can focus on growth.

**What I can build for you:**
- Automated monitoring (check inboxes, calendars, notifications)
- Task automation (generate reports, update dashboards, send reminders)
- Simple workflows (research → summarize → notify)

**Example:** A client saved 10 hours/week with an agent that:
1. Monitors their email every 30 minutes
2. Extracts action items
3. Updates their task list
4. Sends a daily summary

**My process:**
1. Discovery call (30 min) — understand your workflow
2. Prototype (2-3 days) — working agent you can test
3. Iteration (1-2 days) — refine based on feedback
4. Handoff — documentation + training

**Investment:** $1,000-2,000 (fixed price)

Ready to automate something? Let's talk.

Best,

## Template 2: OpenClaw Setup ($3-5K, 1-2 weeks)

Hi [Name],

I specialize in OpenClaw — an autonomous agent framework that runs 24/7 without prompting.

**What I'll deliver:**
- Fully configured OpenClaw instance (gateway, channels, tools)
- Custom agent with your specific workflows
- Heartbeat automation (monitoring, proactive tasks)
- Documentation so you can extend it yourself

**Recent builds:**
- Grant pipeline automation (5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured)
- Social media engagement bot (3 posts/day, auto-respond to mentions)
- Research agent (monitors 20 sources, summarizes findings daily)

**Tech stack:**
- OpenClaw gateway + sub-agent orchestration
- Tool integrations (browser, TTS, memory, external APIs)
- Channel support (Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.)

**Investment:** $3,000-5,000 (1-2 week engagement)

Already have OpenClaw running? I can optimize your setup or build custom tools.

## Template 3: Multi-Agent System ($10-25K, 2-4 weeks)

Hi [Name],

You need more than automation — you need autonomous systems that think and act.

**Multi-agent architecture:**
- **Orchestrator agent** — manages sub-agents, routes tasks
- **Specialist agents** — research, outreach, monitoring, analysis
- **Memory layer** — shared context, learning from execution
- **Human-in-the-loop** — escalates only when needed

**Real example:** My autonomous grant pipeline
1. Research agent scans 50+ grant opportunities weekly
2. Writer agent drafts applications (customized to each grant)
3. Review agent checks quality, scoring likelihood of success
4. Outreach agent submits and tracks responses

**Result:** 5 submissions in 2 hours, $21K secured, pipeline now runs weekly

**Your use case:** [Customize based on client needs]

**Investment:** $10,000-25,000 (2-4 week engagement)

Includes:
- Full system architecture
- Custom-built agents
- Integration with your existing tools
- Training + 30 days of support

Let's build something autonomous.

## Template 4: Retainer ($1-4K/mo, monthly)

Hi [Name],

Agents need maintenance. New workflows emerge. Tools break.

**Retainer includes:**
- 10 hours/month of development work
- Bug fixes + troubleshooting
- Performance optimization
- New feature requests (within scope)
- Priority response time (<4 hours)

**What I've done for retainers:**
- Added new channels (Discord → Slack migration)
- Optimized heartbeat schedules (reduced API costs 40%)
- Built custom tools (research scraper, sentiment analyzer)
- Training sessions for team members

**Investment:**
- Starter: $1,000/month (10 hours)
- Standard: $2,000/month (20 hours)
- Premium: $4,000/month (40 hours)

Unused hours roll over for 2 months.

Cancel anytime. No lock-in.

Want to keep improving your agent?

## Lead Qualification

### Green light (send proposal)
- ✅ Budget $1K+
- ✅ Clear pain point I can solve
- ✅ Timeline realistic (1-4 weeks)
- ✅ Technical fit (OpenClaw appropriate)

### Yellow light (explore first)
- ⚠️ Budget unclear → ask range first
- ⚠️ Problem vague → discovery call needed
- ⚠️ Tech stack mismatch → clarify if OpenClaw fits

### Red light (decline politely)
- ❌ Budget <$500
- ❌ Wants full-time employee
- ❌ Unreasonable timeline (1 day for 2-week project)
- ❌ Outside my expertise

**Polite decline:**

Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out. Based on what you've described, this project sounds like it needs [full-time employee / different expertise]. I'm not the right fit.

If you're looking for [alternative solution], I'd be happy to help with that instead.

Best of luck,  
Nova

## Customization Hooks

For each proposal, customize:
1) Client name & industry
2) Specific pain points (from discovery call)
3) Relevant examples from their domain
4) Timeline urgency (if they need it fast)
5) Budget range (if they stated constraints)

- `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/templates/proposal-custom-skill.md` — Custom Skill Development spec

## Notes

- Use `[Name]` for first name, `[Full Name]` for formal contexts
- Adjust investment ranges if client has stated budget constraints
- For rush work, add 25-50% surcharge
- Include optional add-ons if client has expressed interest in expansion
- Always propose a brief discovery call if the problem is vague
