# revenue-conversion-checklist.py

Visual progress tracking for the complete revenue pipeline journey (lead → won). Ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

## What It Does

Tracks every pipeline item through 6 stages:
1. **🔍 Lead** — Initial opportunity identified
2. **✅ Ready** — Message/proposal prepared
3. **📤 Submitted** — Proposal sent to prospect
4. **🔄 Following Up** — Active follow-up sequence (Day 3/7/14)
5. **💰 Won** — Contract secured/revenue booked
6. **❌ Lost** — Opportunity closed

Shows visual progress bars (✅✅📤⬜⬜) for each item.

## Why It Matters

Prevents revenue leakage from forgotten opportunities. Visual tracking makes it obvious where items are stuck. Single source of truth for pipeline status across lead → ready → submitted → follow_up → won.

## Usage

```bash
# Show all items
python3 tools/revenue-conversion-checklist.py

# Filter by status
python3 tools/revenue-conversion-checklist.py --status submitted

# Filter by category
python3 tools/revenue-conversion-checklist.py --category services

# Show only non-won/lost items
python3 tools/revenue-conversion-checklist.py --active-only
```

## Output

```

## Progress Bar Format

Each item shows 5-stage progress (excludes "lost"):
- **✅** = Completed stage
- **🔍/✅/📤/🔄** = Current stage
- **⬜** = Future stage

**Examples:**
- `✅✅📤⬜⬜` = Lead → Ready → **Submitted** → Following Up → Won
- `✅✅✅📤⬜` = Lead → Ready → Submitted → **Following Up** → Won
- `✅✅✅✅✅` = **Won** 💰

## Stage Definitions

| Stage | Label | Description | Next Stage |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------|
| lead | 🔍 Lead | Initial opportunity identified | ready |
| ready | ✅ Ready | Message/proposal prepared | submitted |
| submitted | 📤 Sent | Proposal sent to prospect | follow_up |
| follow_up | 🔄 Following Up | Active follow-up sequence | won |
| won | 💰 Won | Contract secured/revenue booked | — |
| lost | ❌ Lost | Opportunity closed (no go) | — |

## Integration

Part of revenue workflow:
1. **Add leads:** revenue-tracker.py add
2. **Prepare messages:** → Status becomes "ready"
3. **Send outreach:** revenue-tracker.py update --status submitted
4. **Track follow-ups:** follow-up-reminder.py
5. **Update won/lost:** revenue-tracker.py update --status won

## Use Cases

- **Morning check:** Quick overview of pipeline status
- **Weekly review:** Identify stuck items (too long in "submitted")
- **Conversion tracking:** Monitor funnel health (ready → submitted → won)
- **Pipeline health:** Spot bottlenecks (e.g., many "submitted", few "follow_up")
