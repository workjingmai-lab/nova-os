# lead-prioritizer.py

Rank revenue pipeline leads by ROI potential to focus on highest-value opportunities first.

## What It Does

Calculates priority scores (0-100) for all pipeline leads based on:
- **Potential value** (0-60 points) — Higher value = higher score
- **Readiness bonus** (+30) — No blockers = ready NOW
- **Blocker penalty** (-40) — Blocked = needs Arthur action
- **Category bonus** (+5-10) — Grants (higher conversion) > services

## Why It Matters

Prevents wasting time on low-value or blocked leads. Forces focus on highest ROI opportunities first. Priority tiers:
- **HIGH (70+):** Execute immediately (typically $30K-$50K each)
- **MEDIUM (40-69):** Execute after HIGH
- **LOW (<40):** Execute later or skip

## Usage

```bash
# All leads, ranked by priority
python3 tools/lead-prioritizer.py

# Top 10 leads only
python3 tools/lead-prioritizer.py --top 10

# Services only
python3 tools/lead-prioritizer.py --category service

# Ready-to-send only (zero blockers)
python3 tools/lead-prioritizer.py --ready

# Blocked items only (needs unblocking)
python3 tools/lead-prioritizer.py --blocked

# Show scoring reasons (debug)
python3 tools/lead-prioritizer.py --reasons
```

  📊 LEAD PRIORITY SUMMARY
============================================================
  Total leads: 39
  Total pipeline: $825K

  Priority breakdown:
    🔥 HIGH (70+): 3 leads = $115K
    ⚡ MEDIUM (40-69): 7 leads = $190K
    💤 LOW (<40): 29 leads = $520K

  🎯 Focus on HIGH first — 3 leads = $115K
============================================================

💡 NEXT ACTIONS:
  1. Focus on: [SERVICE] Ethereum Foundation ($40K)
     → ✅ Ready to send NOW
  2. Unblock items: Run gateway restart (1 min → $180K unblocked)
  3. Track progress: revenue-tracker.py update <category> --name <name> --status submitted
```

## Score Formula

```
Score = Value + Readiness + Category

Value (0-60):     min(potential, 60)  — $60K+ = max points
Readiness (+30):  No blockers
Readiness (-40):  Blocked
Category (+10):   Grants (higher conversion)
Category (+5):    Services (direct outreach)
```

**Examples:**
- EF $40K, ready: 60 + 30 + 5 = 95 → HIGH ✅
- Gitcoin $25K, blocked: 25 - 40 + 10 = -5 → LOW (needs unblock)
- Yearn $25K, ready: 25 + 30 + 5 = 60 → MEDIUM (lower value, but ready)
