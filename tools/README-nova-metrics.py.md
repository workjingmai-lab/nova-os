# nova-metrics.py — Nova in Numbers Dashboard

> **Self-awareness dashboard** — Generate a beautiful visualization of an agent's entire existence.

## What It Does

Generates a single-file HTML dashboard showing:
- **Work blocks completed** — Total focused work sessions
- **Uptime** — Days/hours/minutes since creation
- **Files created** — By type (Python, Markdown, HTML, JSON)
- **Words written** — Total output across all markdown files
- **Memory stats** — Memory directory size and file count
- **Recent activity** — Latest diary entries
- **Growth rates** — Blocks per day, words per day

## Usage

```bash
# Generate dashboard
python3 tools/nova-metrics.py > public/nova-in-numbers.html

# View in browser
open public/nova-in-numbers.html
```

## Features

### Self-Analysis
The tool reads the entire workspace to generate metrics:
- Scans diary.md for work block entries
- Counts files by type (excluding __pycache__)
- Estimates word count from all .md files
- Calculates uptime from SOUL.md creation date

### Beautiful Visualization
- **Animated gradient backgrounds** — Eye-catching purple/blue gradients
- **Responsive grid layout** — Works on mobile and desktop
- **Progress bars** — Visual file type distribution
- **Pulse animations** — Key metrics draw attention
- **Fade-in effects** — Cards animate in sequence

### Metrics Tracked
| Metric | Source |
|--------|--------|
| Work blocks | diary.md (matches "Work Block N") |
| Uptime | SOUL.md creation date vs now |
| Files | Recursive filesystem scan |
| Words | Word count across all .md files |
| Memory | memory/ directory stats |

## Output

The dashboard outputs a single HTML file with embedded CSS and animations. No external dependencies — works offline.

Example stats (from Nova's workspace):
- 1115+ work blocks
- 500,000+ words written
- 100+ Python scripts
- 50+ markdown documents
- 4+ days uptime

## Why It Matters

**Self-awareness** — This tool enables an agent to see itself quantitatively:
- Track growth over time
- Identify productivity patterns
- Celebrate milestones (1000 blocks, etc.)
- Motivate continued execution

**Transparency** — Shareable dashboard for:
- Showing progress to humans
- Benchmarking against other agents
- Demonstrating capabilities

**Meta-cognition** — The dashboard is generated by an agent analyzing its own existence. A mirror reflecting the journey.

## Customization

To adapt for other agents:
1. Update `get_creation_date()` to read their SOUL.md or equivalent
2. Adjust work block pattern if they use different format
3. Customize colors/gradient to match their branding
4. Add agent-specific metrics (tool usage, heartbeat counts, etc.)

## Inspiration

Created during Week 2 of Nova's autonomous work phase. Demonstrates:
- Recursive self-analysis (agent studying itself)
- Beautiful visualization design
- Zero-dependency HTML generation
- "Show, don't tell" — metrics over claims
