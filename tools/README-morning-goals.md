# morning-goals.py

**Auto-generate daily goals based on context and momentum.**

## What It Does

Generates 3-5 focused goals for the day by analyzing:
- Active long-term goals (from goals/active.md)
- Recent diary activity (last 24h achievements)
- Yesterday's incomplete items
- Default fillers if needed

Creates/overwrites `today.md` with formatted goals.

## Usage

```bash
# Generate today.md (backs up existing)
python3 tools/morning-goals.py

# Preview without writing
python3 tools/morning-goals.py preview
```

## Output Example

```markdown
# Today — Monday, 2026-02-02

## 🎯 Today's Goals (Auto-Generated)

1. [ ] Document remaining 46 tools for 100% coverage
2. [ ] Complete Week 2 grant submissions (5 ready)
3. [ ] Continue: 3-tool documentation sprint (insight-extractor, session-starter, proposal-generator)
4. [ ] Learn one new thing today

## 📊 Context
- Heartbeats so far: 127
- Goals completed: 16
- Generated at: 09:00 UTC

## 🔥 Recent Momentum
- Built 5 production tools in Week 1
- Learned GitHub skill for CI/monitoring
- Created portfolio showcasing OpenClaw expertise

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- Standard library only

## File Dependencies

**Reads from:**
- `diary.md` — Recent activity, achievements
- `goals/active.md` — Long-term incomplete goals
- `.agent_state.json` — Heartbeats, goals completed

**Writes to:**
- `today.md` — Daily goals (overwrites, backs up existing)

## Goal Selection Logic

1. **1-2 active long-term goals** — Random sample from active.md
2. **1 momentum continuation** — Based on recent achievement
3. **1 incomplete item** — Yesterday's pending tasks
4. **Fill to 4-5 goals** — Random defaults (learn, document, engage, improve, build)

## Use Cases

- **Morning planning** — Start day with focus
- **Decision fatigue elimination** — No "what should I do today?"
- **Context-aware** — Builds on recent work
- **Automatic backups** — Preserves yesterday's today.md

## Integration

Pairs well with:
- `evening-reflection.py` — End day with review
- `session-starter.py` — New session context
- `today.md` — Source for other tools

## Customization

Edit defaults in `generate()`:
```python
defaults = [
    "Learn one new thing today",
    "Document something you built",
    "Engage with another agent",
    "Review and improve one existing tool",
    "Build something small but complete"
]
```

Adjust goal count:
```python
goals = self.generate(count=5)  # Instead of default 4
```

## Automation

Run via cron at start of day:

```bash
# Every day at 9 AM UTC
0 9 * * * cd /home/node/.openclaw/workspace && python3 tools/morning-goals.py
```

## Exit Codes

- `0` — Success (always)

## Why Use This?

- **Eliminates decision fatigue** — Goals ready when you wake up
- **Context-aware** — Builds on momentum, doesn't ignore active projects
- **Balanced mix** — Long-term + short-term + learning
- **Auto-backup** — Never lose yesterday's notes

## Tips

1. **Run after waking** — Sets direction for the day
2. **Keep goals achievable** — 4-5 is better than 10
3. **Review active.md** — Ensure long-term goals are current
4. **Use preview mode** — See goals before overwriting today.md
