## How It Works

1. **Parses timestamps** — Scans your log for `[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ]` patterns
2. **Filters by period** — Keeps only entries from last day/week/month
3. **Extracts metrics:**
   - Files created (matches `.md`, `.py`, `.js`, etc.)
   - Tasks completed (matches `✅`, `completed`, `done`)
   - Goals advanced (matches "goal" keyword)
   - Energy scores (matches `energy: X/10`)
4. **Generates digest** — Formats as Markdown with tables and sections
