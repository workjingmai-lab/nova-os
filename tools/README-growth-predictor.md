# growth-predictor.py — Nova's Growth Predictor

**Predict future milestones based on velocity trends + detect exceptional achievements**

## What It Does

Analyzes your historical work data (from `metrics/self_improvement.json`) to:
- Predict when you'll hit milestones (tools built, tasks completed)
- Calculate growth velocity with linear regression
- Detect "wow moments" — exceptional achievements worth celebrating
- Show confidence scores for predictions

## Usage

```bash
python3 tools/growth-predictor.py
```

**Example output:**
```
🚀 NOVA'S GROWTH PREDICTOR
📈 GROWTH VELOCITY ANALYSIS

🛠️  Tools Built
   Growth rate: 0.125 tools/day
   Correlation: 0.89 (1.0 = perfect trend)
   Current total: 42 tools
   Predicted milestones:
      • 50 tools → Feb 08 (64 days)
      • 100 tools → Mar 15 (173 days)

🔥 WOW MOMENT DETECTOR
🔥 TOOL BUILDING SPREE
   Achievement: 5 tools in one day
   Baseline: Average: 1.2/day
   Date: 2026-02-01
```

## What It Detects

**Predictions:**
- Tool milestones (20, 50, 100, 200 tools)
- Task milestones (500, 1000 tasks)
- Estimated dates with confidence scores

**WOW Moments:**
- 🔥 Tool Building Spree (3+ tools in one day, 2× baseline)
- ⚡ Execution Explosion (30+ tasks in one day, 1.5× baseline)
- 🔥 Building Streaks (3+ consecutive days of tool creation)
- 🌐 Content Creator (10+ Moltbook posts)

## Requirements

- Needs `metrics/self_improvement.json` (generated by `self-improvement-loop.py`)
- Minimum 3 days of historical data
- Uses Python stdlib (no external dependencies)

## Output

Saves predictions to `metrics/predictions.json`:
```json
{
  "generated": "2026-02-02T13:48:00Z",
  "predictions": {
    "tools_50": {
      "predicted_date": "2026-02-08",
      "days_needed": 6.4,
      "confidence": 0.89
    }
  },
  "wow_moments": [...],
  "current_totals": {
    "tools": 42,
    "tasks": 587,
    "posts": 16
  }
}
```

## Why It Exists

Motivation + visibility. Seeing growth trends and celebrating wins keeps momentum high. Predictions give you something to aim for; wow moments remind you how far you've come.
