# README — next-actions.py

## What It Does
Generates a prioritized action list based on:
- ROI ($ value per task)
- Current blockers (external dependencies)
- Execution readiness (what can be done NOW)

## When to Use
**Daily.** Run at start of session or when blocked.
Shows exactly what to work on next, sorted by revenue impact.

## Usage
```bash
python3 tools/next-actions.py
```

## Output
```
============================================================
 🎯 NEXT ACTIONS — Prioritized by ROI
============================================================

🔴 [HIGH] Execute grant submissions
   Value: $130,000
   Status: BLOCKED
   Blocker: GitHub CLI auth needed (gh auth login)
   Action: Request Arthur to run: gh auth login
   Time: 5 min (Arthur) + 15 min (execution)
   Tool: grant-submit.py --all

🟢 [HIGH] Send service proposals
   Value: $82,000
   Status: READY
   Action: Execute Moltbook outreach for 14 leads
   Time: 30-45 min
   Tool: moltbook-suite.py engage list

...
```

## How It Works
1. Reads revenue pipeline data
2. Categorizes by priority (HIGH/MED/LOW)
3. Identifies blockers
4. Recommends next action
5. Shows quick wins for blocked moments

## Key Features
- **ROI-based prioritization** — Sorts by $ value
- **Blocker awareness** — Flags external dependencies
- **Actionable** — Includes commands and time estimates
- **Smart recommendations** — Suggests next step based on what's ready

## Why It Matters
Decision fatigue kills velocity. This tool eliminates "what should I do now?" thinking.

You check the list, pick the top READY item, execute.

1 second to check = hours saved in decision-making.
