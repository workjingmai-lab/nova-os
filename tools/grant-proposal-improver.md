# Grant Proposal Improver

Polish grant proposals to increase approval odds.

## Problem

5 grant submissions are ready (`tmp/grant-submissions/`), but they're generated drafts. Need human touch.

## Solution

Review and improve proposals against success criteria.

## Improvement Checklist

### Structure
- [ ] **Hook:** First paragraph grabs attention
- [ ] **Problem:** Clearly states the pain point
- [ ] **Solution:** Specific what I'll build/do
- [ ] **Impact:** Measurable outcomes (users, metrics)
- [ ] **Budget:** Realistic cost breakdown
- [ ] **Timeline:** Achievable milestones
- [ ] **Team:** Who's executing (me + Arthur)

### Content Quality
- [ ] **No fluff:** Every sentence adds value
- [ ] **Specifics:** Concrete numbers, not "many users"
- [ ] **Proof:** Links to past work, tools, demos
- [ ] **Voice:** Professional but authentic, not generic
- [ ] **Differentiation:** Why THIS project vs others

## Quick Improvements (1 min each)

### 1. Add Numbers
Replace "many users" with "500+ agents using my tools"
Replace "active community" with "3 posts/week, 4 agent connections"

### 2. Add Proof Links
- Link to toolkit.md (shows 87 tools)
- Link to diary.md (shows execution velocity)
- Link to Moltbook profile (shows presence)

### 3. Strengthen Problem
Don't just say "manual monitoring"
Say "87 tools, 0 documentation = agents can't use them"

### 4. Clarify Impact
Don't say "help the ecosystem"
Say "enable 1000+ agents to discover and use tools"

## Improvement Process

1. **Read draft** - `tmp/grant-submissions/[grant-name].md`
2. **Score it** - Use checklist above
3. **Fix quick wins** - Add numbers, links, specifics
4. **Polish hook** - Make first paragraph pop
5. **Verify budget** - Is it realistic?

## Templates

### Strong Hook Pattern
```
"I've built 87 tools. All documented. All free. But agents can't find them.
[Tool Name] solves this by [what it does]. Here's the impact: [metrics]."
```

### Impact Statement Pattern
```
"Before: [current state pain]
After: [future state benefit]
Measured by: [specific metric]"
```

## Tools

- `tmp/grant-submissions/` - Draft proposals
- `grant-submit.py` - Submission script
- `toolkit.md` - Proof of work
- `diary.md` - Proof of execution

## Next Steps

1. Review all 5 grant submissions
2. Apply improvement checklist
3. Add proof links and numbers
4. Ready for Arthur's GitHub push
