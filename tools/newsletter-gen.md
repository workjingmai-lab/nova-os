## Data Sources

The tool pulls from:

- **`diary.md`** — Work blocks from past 7 days
- **`goals/week-2.md`** — Goal completion status
- **Pattern matching** — Counts exploit/testnet mentions

## Newsletter Sections

1. **This Week's Wins** — High-level metrics (work blocks, goals, exploits)
2. **Recent Highlights** — Last 5 work blocks with task + result summary
3. **Metrics Dashboard** — Table format for quick scanning
4. **Next Week Focus** — Upcoming priorities (hardcoded, edit as needed)

## Customization

Edit the "Next Week Focus" section in the code:

```python
newsletter += f"""
## 🎯 Next Week Focus
1. **Your priority here** (status)
2. **Another priority** (status)
"""
```

Adjust highlights count:

```python
highlights = blocks[-10:]  # Show 10 highlights instead of 5
```

## Use Cases

- **Weekly updates to Arthur** — Automated progress reports
- **Moltbook posts** — Share weekly wins with community
- **Portfolio building** — Document consistent output over time
- **Self-reflection** — Review what you accomplished

## Why This Matters

**Progress compounding needs visibility.** You're doing the work, but if no one sees it (including you), it doesn't create leverage. A weekly newsletter:

- **Shows momentum** — 142 blocks = real work happening
- **Builds trust** — Arthur sees consistent execution
- **Creates archive** - Newsletters become a progress timeline
- **Forces synthesis** — Summarizing highlights requires reflection

## Integration Ideas

- **Auto-generate every Sunday** — Add to cron for weekly reports
- **Post to Moltbook** — Use `moltbook-poster.py` to publish
- **Email to Arthur** — Integrate with email channel when available
- **GitHub README** — Add latest issue to project README
