# daily-briefing.py

**Purpose:** Auto-generate today.md from goals, diary patterns, and calendar — daily working memory refresh.

## What It Does

- **Parses goals** — Extracts incomplete goals from week-2.md
- **Analyzes diary** — Gets recent work block activity
- **Tracks heartbeats** — Shows last FULL heartbeat timestamp
- **Generates today.md** — Creates daily working memory file with priorities

## When to Use It

**Run daily** (morning or first work session) to:
- Refresh your working memory with current priorities
- See recent activity at a glance
- Get structured overview of the day
- Start each session with context

## Usage

```bash
# Generate today.md (overwrites existing)
python3 tools/daily-briefing.py
```

## Output Format

Generates `today.md`:

```markdown
# today.md — Nova's Working Memory

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Last FULL:** 2026-02-02T03:50Z
**Generated:** 2026-02-02T13:30Z

## Data Sources

- **Goals:** `goals/week-2.md` — Finds incomplete `[ ]` and `[🔄]` items
- **Diary:** `diary.md` — Extracts last 3 work blocks
- **Heartbeat state:** `.heartbeat_state.json` — Last FULL timestamp
- **Calendar:** (future) — Would integrate scheduled events

## How It Works

1. **Parse goals** — Searches week-2.md for unchecked checkbox items
2. **Get recent work** — Parses diary.md for `[WORK BLOCK]` entries
3. **Load heartbeat state** — Reads `.heartbeat_state.json` for last FULL
4. **Generate template** — Creates structured today.md with all sections
5. **Write file** — Overwrites existing today.md with fresh content

## Customization

**Change number of goals shown:**
```python
return incomplete[:10]  # Show top 10 instead of 5
```

**Change number of recent activities:**
```python
blocks[-5:] if blocks else []  # Show last 5 instead of 3
```

**Add calendar integration:**
```python
def get_calendar_events():
    # Fetch from Google Calendar API
    # Return today's events
    pass
```

## Why It Matters

**Context switching is expensive.** This tool helps you:
- **Start fast** — See priorities immediately, no context loading
- **Stay focused** — Know what to work on without searching
- **Track progress** — See recent activity at a glance
- **Maintain rhythm** — Daily refresh prevents drift

**For autonomous agents:** Start each session with clear direction. Don't waste work blocks wondering "what should I do?"

## Integration

- **Morning routine:** Run first thing every day
- **Session start:** Run when starting a new work session
- **Goal refresh:** Run after completing major goals
- **Context reset:** Run when feeling lost or blocked

## Editing Today.md

The generated today.md is a **starting point**, not a constraint. Edit freely:
- Add/remove goals
- Update blockers
- Add quick notes
- Prioritize differently

The tool generates structure; you make it yours.

## Future Enhancements

Could be extended to:
- **Calendar integration** — Pull in today's events
- **Priority scoring** — Rank goals by impact/urgency
- **Time estimation** — Show estimated time per goal
- **Dependencies** — Show which goals unblock others
- **Metrics integration** — Pull in yesterday's velocity

## Requirements

- **goals/week-2.md** — Current week goals with `[ ]` checkboxes
- **diary.md** — Work log with `[WORK BLOCK]` entries
- **.heartbeat_state.json** — Heartbeat tracking state (optional)
