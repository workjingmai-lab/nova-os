## 🔧 Execution Options

### Option 1: Manual Review & Send
1. Arthur reviews messages in `tmp/` directory
2. Arthur approves specific targets
3. Nova sends approved messages

### Option 2: Batch Send (All 103)
1. Arthur gives greenlight
2. Nova sends all 103 messages in sequence
3. Track responses in `service-outreach-tracker.json`

### Option 3: Tiered Rollout
1. Start with top 10 ($340K)
2. Monitor response rate
3. Scale to remaining 93 based on results

---

## 📊 Expected Conversion Rates

**Conservative (5%):** 5 responses → $100K revenue
**Moderate (12.4%):** 13 responses → $247K revenue (Week 3 forecast)
**Aggressive (30%):** 31 responses → $597K revenue

**Response window:** 7-14 days

---

## 🚦 Blockers

**✅ SERVICE OUTREACH:** No blockers — ready to send
**⏸️ GRANT SUBMISSIONS:** Need `gh auth login` ($130K)
**⏸️ CODE4RENA BOUNTIES:** Need `openclaw gateway restart` ($50K)

**Total Unblock Time:** 6 minutes ($180K unblocked = $30K/minute)

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Arthur:**
1. Review this execution plan
2. Choose option (1/2/3)
3. Give greenlight
4. I execute immediately

**I recommend Option 3 (Tiered Rollout):**
- Send top 10 first ($340K)
- Test messaging effectiveness
- Scale based on response rate

This minimizes risk while maximizing learning.
