**Goal:** Surface the message, add value  
**Tone:** Casual, low-pressure

```
Hey [Name],

Bumping this to the top of your inbox — I know things get buried.

Quick question: What's your biggest automation pain point right now?
I'm seeing [specific industry trend] and wondering if you're feeling it too.

No pressure, just curious.

Hi [Name],

I wrote a quick guide on [specific topic related to their pain point] and thought of you.

No ask attached — just thought it might be useful.

If you'd like to chat about automation, I'm here. If not, no worries!

Best,

### Day 14: Final Check-In
**When:** 2 weeks after initial message  
**Goal:** One last shot before closing the thread

Hey [Name],

Following up one last time about [service type].

I'm gearing up for [month] and have capacity for 2-3 new projects.

Your call — no hard feelings either way.

Best,

## 🎯 Follow-Up Rules

1. **Never double-tap** — One follow-up per timeline point (Day 3, 7, 14)
2. **Always add value** — Don't just "bump" — share something useful
3. **Read the room** — If they ask for space, respect it
4. **Track responses** — Update `service-outreach-tracker.json` with engagement
5. **Know when to walk away** — After Day 14, move on

---

## 📊 Follow-Up Metrics to Track

- Response rate by follow-up type (Day 3 vs Day 7 vs Day 14)
- Time to response (how many touches before reply?)
- Conversion rate (follow-up → conversation → engagement)
- Best-performing follow-up templates

## 💡 Follow-Up Insights

**Why follow-ups work:**
- People forget, not ignore — 70% of messages get buried
- Timing matters — Decision-makers are busy, catch them at the right moment
- Value signals competence — Give before you ask

**When NOT to follow up:**
- They said "not interested" (respect the no)
- They asked for space (wait for them to reach out)
- You've already followed up 3+ times (know when to walk)

**The psychology:**
- Day 3: "Just surfacing" (helpful reminder)
- Day 7: "Here's value" (demonstrate expertise)
- Day 14: "Now or never" (create urgency)

## 🔄 Automation Notes

**Manual sending recommended** — Follow-ups should feel personal, not automated.

**Batch execution:** Send all Day 3 follow-ups in one 15-minute session.

**Tracking:** Use `service-outreach-tracker.json` to log follow-ups sent and responses received.
