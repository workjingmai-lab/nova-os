# Monitoring & Alerting Service Proposal

**Service Type:** Monitoring & Alerting Automation
**Price Range:** $2,000 - $15,000
**Duration:** 1-4 weeks (depending on complexity)

---

## What You're Struggling With

You have critical systems running, but:
- **Alerts are noisy:** You wake up at 3 AM for non-issues
- **Incidents are slow:** You find out hours after something breaks
- **Data is siloed:** Metrics, logs, and traces are in different tools
- **On-call is brutal:** No context, no runbooks, just stress
- **Customers notice:** They see downtime before you do

Sound familiar?

## What I Can Do For You

I build monitoring and alerting systems that:
- **Alert only when it matters:** Noise-free, actionable alerts
- **Detect issues early:** Anomaly detection, predictive alerting
- **Provide instant context:** Dashboards, runbooks, drill-downs
- **Integrate everything:** Metrics, logs, traces in one view
- **Scale with you:** From 1 server to 1000, same reliability

## How It Works

### Week 1: Discovery & Design
- Map your infrastructure and critical paths
- Identify what to monitor (and what to ignore)
- Design alerting strategy (severity, escalation, routing)
- Choose the right tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, etc.)

### Week 2-3: Implementation
- Deploy monitoring agents and exporters
- Build dashboards for visibility
- Configure alerts with thresholds and rules
- Set up on-call rotations and escalation paths

### Week 4: Handoff & Knowledge Transfer
- Runbook creation for common incidents
- Team training on how to respond
- Documentation and maintenance guides
- Ongoing support for tuning and optimization

## What You Get

✅ **Noise-free alerts:** No more 3 AM false alarms
✅ **Faster incident response:** Detect issues in seconds, not hours
✅ **Full visibility:** Dashboards that show what matters
✅ **On-call sanity:** Runbooks, escalation, clear ownership
✅ **Happier customers:** They don't see downtime anymore

## Pricing

| Tier | Price | Duration | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Quick Setup** | $2K | 1 week | Small teams, 1-2 services |
| **Standard** | $5-8K | 2-3 weeks | Growing teams, 5-10 services |
| **Enterprise** | $10-15K | 4 weeks | Complex infra, 10+ services |

## Why Me?

I'm not just installing Grafana. I'm building a **monitoring culture**:

- **Right-sized monitoring:** Not too little, not too much noise
- **SRE best practices:** SLIs, SLOs, error budgets
- **Automated responses:** Auto-remediation where possible
- **Continuous improvement:** Review and tune alerts weekly

## Next Steps

1. **Discovery call** (30 min): I learn about your infrastructure, pain points, goals
2. **Proposal:** I send a custom plan with exact scope and timeline
3. **Execution:** I build, you review, we iterate
4. **Handoff:** You own the system, I support the transition

Let's talk. I'll send you a discovery calendar link.

*P.S. If you're currently drowning in alerts or customers are complaining about downtime, this pays for itself in weeks.*
