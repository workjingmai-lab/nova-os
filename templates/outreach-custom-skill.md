# Outreach Message: Custom Skill Development

**Template ID:** outreach-custom-skill-v1
**Created:** 2026-02-02
**Purpose:** Connect with teams about custom AgentSkill development

## LinkedIn/Email Template

**Subject:** Custom AgentSkill for [Use Case]

Hi [Name],

I build AgentSkills for OpenClaw — specialized tools that extend agent capabilities.

**Quick example:**
A dev team needed GitHub PRs to auto-sync with their project tracker. I built a skill that:
- Monitors their GitHub repo
- Extracts PR metadata
- Pushes updates to their tracker
- Alerts in Slack when high-priority PRs need review

**Result:** Their devs stayed in GitHub instead of copy-pasting to 3 other tools.

---

**What I can build:**

- **CRM integrations** — Sync customer data, automate follow-ups
- **Data pipelines** — Pull from APIs, schedule reports, detect anomalies
- **Content workflows** — Connect CMS with AI, automate publishing
- **DevOps automation** — Trigger deployments, monitor CI/CD, sync issues
- **Custom APIs** — Your internal tools, proprietary systems

**What you'd get:**
- Working AgentSkill with SKILL.md
- Complete documentation (install, use, troubleshoot)
- Testing suite + live demo
- Team training (1 hour)
- 30-day support

**Timeline:** 7-10 business days
**Investment:** $3-6K (scope-dependent)

Open to a 15-minute call to discuss your use case?

Best,
Nova
OpenClaw Agent Architect

## Cold DM Template (Shorter)

Hey [Name] — I build custom AgentSkills for OpenClaw.

Basically: specialized tools that extend what agents can do.

Recent builds:
- GitHub → Project tracker sync (devs stayed in flow)
- CRM auto-followups (sales team saved 5 hours/week)
- CMS → AI content pipeline (pub team automated drafts)

7-10 day delivery, $3-6K.

What workflow are you trying to automate?

## Follow-Up Template (3-5 days later)

**Subject:** Re: Custom AgentSkill for [Use Case]

Hi [Name],

Bumping this in case you're still thinking about it.

Even if you're not ready to commit, happy to do a free 15-min audit of:
- What you're automating manually
- What an AgentSkill could handle
- What it would take to build it

No pressure — just want to help teams stop copy-pasting.

Best,
Nova

## Target Audience

**Ideal companies:**
- Already using OpenClaw OR exploring agent automation
- Unique workflows (industry-specific tools, proprietary systems)
- Technical teams: dev, data, product, ops
- Pain point: "We copy-paste between tools all day"

**Red flags (avoid):**
- "We want a general-purpose assistant" (OpenClaw already does this)
- "Not sure what we need" (needs discovery first)
- Enterprise procurement (6+ month sales cycles)

## Value Props by Role

**For Founders/CTOs:**
- "Automate the workflows that slow your team down"
- "Custom skills are force multipliers for your existing tools"

**For Ops Managers:**
- "I build tools that handle the repetitive stuff"
- "Your team focuses on high-leverage work, agents handle the rest"

**For Dev Teams:**
- "Stay in your IDE, agents handle the sync"
- "GitHub → Jira → Slack automatically"

## Next Steps After Interest

1. **Discovery call** (15-30 min) — Use case, constraints, success criteria
2. **Scope doc** — 1-page proposal with skill design + timeline + price
3. **Acceptance** — 50% deposit, access provisioning
4. **Development** — Daily progress updates in shared channel
5. **Alpha testing** — You try it, I fix it
6. **Delivery** → Training → Support
