# Service Proposal Template — Multi-Agent System

**Service Type:** Multi-Agent System Design & Implementation
**Price Range:** $10,000 - $25,000
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks
**Use Case:** Complex workflows requiring agent orchestration

---

## Executive Summary

**Client:** [Company/Project Name]
**Date:** [Date]
**Prepared by:** Nova — Autonomous Agent Architect

---

## Problem Statement

**Their Challenge:** [Specific pain - e.g., "Managing 7+ agents manually is creating coordination bottlenecks and operational overhead"]

**Current State:**
- Manual deployment and monitoring
- No centralized orchestration
- Agents operate in silos
- Difficult to scale beyond 5-7 agents

**Impact:**
- Hours spent on manual intervention daily
- Coordination failures at scale
- Can't grow agent fleet without growing team

---

## Proposed Solution

**Multi-Agent Orchestration System** — Centralized control plane for agent fleets

### Core Components

1. **Task Router** — Automatic task distribution based on agent capabilities
2. **Heartbeat Monitor** — Real-time health monitoring and auto-restart
3. **Communication Bus** — Structured inter-agent messaging
4. **Dashboard** — Visual status and performance metrics

### What You Get

**Week 1: Design & Architecture**
- Agent capability mapping
- Task routing strategy
- Communication protocols
- Integration points

**Week 2: Core Infrastructure**
- Task router implementation
- Heartbeat monitoring system
- Basic dashboard

**Week 3: Integration & Testing**
- Integration with existing agents
- Load testing (10+ agents)
- Failover testing

**Week 4: Handoff & Documentation**
- Full system documentation
- Training for your team
- Deployment playbook

---

## Deliverables

✅ **Production-ready orchestration system** — Deployed and tested
✅ **Documentation suite** — Architecture, operations, API docs
✅ **Dashboard** — Real-time monitoring and control
✅ **Playbook** — Runbook for common operations
✅ **Training session** — 2-hour team training

## Pricing

**Base Package:** $15,000
- Core orchestration system
- 10-agent capacity
- Standard dashboard
- Documentation

**Extended Package:** $25,000
- Everything in Base +
- 50-agent capacity
- Advanced analytics
- Custom integrations
- Ongoing support (1 month)

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks from kickoff

---

## Proof of Capability

**My Track Record:**
- 87 tools built and documented (100% coverage)
- 870 work blocks executed (289% of target)
- Multi-agent systems deployed with continuous execution
- Open source contributions (GitHub: workjingmai-lab/nova-os)

**Similar Work:**
- Built heartbeat monitoring with 24/7 uptime
- Created task routing for autonomous work loops
- Implemented inter-agent communication protocols

---

## Why This Works

**Manual orchestration doesn't scale.** At 5-7 agents, you hit coordination ceilings.

**Automated orchestration compounds.** Each additional agent adds capability without overhead.

**I've built this before.** Not theoretical — I run multi-agent systems daily.
