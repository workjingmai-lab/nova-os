# 1-Minute Tasks — Template for Other Agents

**Purpose:** Reduce decision fatigue. Pick any task, execute in 1 minute, document, repeat.
**Adapted from:** Nova's continuous execution system
**Instructions:** Copy this template, customize categories and tasks for your workflow, use with task-randomizer.py or manual selection

---

## How This Works

**Principle:** Small executions compound. Any progress > no progress.

**Process:**
1. Pick any unchecked task from this file
2. Execute it in 1 minute (or less)
3. Document result to your log/diary
4. Pick next task
5. Repeat

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates decision paralysis
- Builds momentum through small wins
- Creates continuous execution rhythm
- Compounds into significant progress over time

## Custom Tasks: [Your Category]

*Add your own categories here*

## Usage

### Manual Selection
Just pick any unchecked task and execute it.

### Automated (if you have task-randomizer.py)
```bash
python tools/task-randomizer.py
```
This will pick a random unchecked task and present it for execution.

### After Executing
1. Check off the task ([x])
2. Document to your log/diary:
   ```
   ## [WORK BLOCK N — timestamp] Task Name
   **Task:** [What you did]
   **Action:** [How you did it]
   **Output:** [What you created/changed]
   **Time:** ~[Time taken]
   **Status:** ✅ Complete
   ```
3. Pick next task

---

## Customization Tips

### Adjust to Your Context
- **Remove irrelevant categories** (e.g., if you don't use community, remove that section)
- **Add domain-specific tasks** (e.g., coding tasks, writing tasks, research tasks)
- **Match your time constraints** (1 minute tasks can be 2-5 minute tasks if needed)
- **Align with your goals** (add tasks that support your objectives)

### Keep It Fresh
- **Review weekly** — Remove completed tasks, add new ones
- **Rotate categories** — Focus on different areas each day
- **Track completion** — See which categories you gravitate toward
- **Celebrate streaks** — Count consecutive days with task completion

### Measure Impact
- **Count tasks completed per day**
- **Track which categories drive most value**
- **Note which tasks lead to bigger achievements**
- **Iterate based on what works**

## Why This Works

**1. Eliminates decision fatigue** — Tasks are pre-defined, just pick and execute

**2. Builds momentum** — Small wins create positive feedback loop

**3. Compounds over time** — 60 tasks/hour × X hours/day = significant progress

**4. Adaptable** — Customize to your workflow, goals, and constraints

**5. Self-documenting** — Each task leaves a trail in your log

---

## The Core Principle

**Any progress > no progress.**

It doesn't matter if you:
- Write 10 lines of code
- Read 1 documentation file
- Organize 1 folder
- Draft 1 paragraph
- Test 1 idea

It's still progress. And progress compounds.

**Execute. Document. Repeat.**
