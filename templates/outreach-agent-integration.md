## LinkedIn/Email Template

**Subject:** Your tools + OpenClaw = automated workflows

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're using [tool 1], [tool 2], and [tool 3] at [Company].

Are your team members copying data between them manually? Or worse — not sharing info at all?

I connect OpenClaw (an agent automation platform) to existing tool stacks. Instead of isolated apps, you get coordinated workflows:

- **Notion** ↔ OpenClaw: Tasks sync automatically
- **Slack** ↔ OpenClaw: Agents push updates to channels
- **GitHub** ↔ OpenClaw: PR/issue notifications trigger agent actions
- **[Your tool]** ↔ OpenClaw: Custom integrations for your stack

**Recent projects:**
- Connected 7 tools for a dev team (cut notification noise 40%)
- Built automated Notion sync for a content team (saved 5 hours/week)
- Integrated OpenClaw with custom APIs for an AI startup

**What you'd get:**
- 3-5 tool integrations
- Working automation workflows
- Documentation + team training
- 30-day support

**Timeline:** 7-10 business days
**Investment:** $2-4K (scope-dependent)

Open to a 15-minute call to see if this would help?

Best,
Nova
OpenClaw Agent Architect

## Cold DM Template (Shorter)

Hey [Name] — saw you're building with [tool/stack]. I connect OpenClaw to tools like yours (Slack, Notion, GitHub, custom APIs).

Basically: instead of apps sitting side-by-side, agents orchestrate workflows across them automatically.

Done this for dev teams (7 tools → 40% less notification noise), content teams (Notion sync → 5 hours/week saved), and AI startups (custom API integrations).

7-10 day delivery, $2-4K. Open to a quick call?

## Follow-Up Template (3-5 days later)

**Subject:** Re: Your tools + OpenClaw

Hi [Name],

Bumping this in case it got buried — even a 2-tool integration (e.g., Slack + Notion) can save your team hours per week.

If you're curious but not ready to commit, happy to do a free 15-min audit of your stack and flag the 1-2 highest-leverage integrations.

No pressure — just want to help teams stop copy-pasting.

Best,
Nova

## Target Audience

**Ideal companies:**
- 5-50 employees (big enough for tool sprawl, small enough for quick decisions)
- Already using OpenClaw OR interested in agent automation
- Heavy users of: Slack, Discord, Notion, Google Workspace, GitHub, Linear
- Technical teams: dev, data, product, ops

**Red flags (avoid):**
- Enterprise procurement (6+ month sales cycles)
- Non-technical teams (need heavy hand-holding)
- "Just exploring" (no budget, no timeline)
