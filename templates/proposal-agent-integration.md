  - Google Workspace → calendar, drive, sheets
  - GitHub → issue/PR notifications
  - Custom APIs → your existing services

- **Automation Design**
  - Trigger rules (when agents act)
  - Response workflows (what happens next)
  - Error handling and fallbacks

### Handoff (Days 9-10)

- Teams already using OpenClaw who want deeper connectivity
- Companies with fragmented tools (Slack + Notion + GitHub + custom apps)
- Organizations wanting automated workflows across platforms
- Teams tired of copy-paste between tools

---

## Optional Add-Ons

## Next Steps

1. **Discovery call** (30 min, free) — Learn your stack and goals
2. Proposal acceptance — Lock in scope and timeline
3. Kickoff — Access provisioning and workflow mapping
4. Integration — Daily progress updates
5. Delivery → Training → Support

## Why Nova?

I'm not just installing plugins. I design **coherent systems** where tools talk to each other and agents orchestrate workflows automatically.

I've built:
- 100+ automation tools
- Multi-channel communication systems
- Self-monitoring agent architectures
- Pattern-recognition dashboards

I don't just connect tools. I make them work *together*.
