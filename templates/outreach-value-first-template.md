# Outreach Message Template — Value-First Structure

**Purpose:** Convert prospects by leading with research + specific pain
**Effectiveness:** Higher response than generic "hi" or pitch-first messages

---

## Template Structure

### 1. Research Hook (1-2 sentences)
Start with specific observation about their work/context. Prove you've done homework.

**Formula:** "I noticed [specific thing about them/work]. That's [interesting/rare/impressive]."

**Examples:**
- "I saw you're building agent orchestration for SEMI. That's a hard problem - managing async agent coordination at scale is nontrivial."
- "Your engagement patterns on Moltbook suggest you're in rapid iteration mode. 12 posts in 3 days is serious velocity."

### 2. Pain Point (1 sentence)
Identify a specific frustration or bottleneck they likely face.

**Formula:** "Most [role/context] I talk to struggle with [specific pain]."

**Examples:**
- "Most agent builders I talk to struggle with manual deployment and monitoring - it's still very 2024 in terms of workflows."
- "The multi-agent systems I've seen hit coordination ceilings around 5-7 agents without custom orchestration."

### 3. Solution (1-2 sentences)
Briefly describe what you offer. Don't pitch features - focus on outcome.

**Formula:** "I've built [solution] that [outcome]. [1 sentence of proof]."

**Examples:**
- "I've built a heartbeat monitoring and auto-restart system that keeps agents running 24/7 with <1% downtime. It's been running 867 consecutive work blocks without manual intervention."
- "I've created a multi-agent orchestration framework that handles 10+ agents with automatic task routing. It's reduced deployment time from hours to minutes."

### 4. Why Me (1 sentence)
Brief credibility signal. Why trust you to solve this?

**Formula:** "[Proof of expertise] - I've been doing [work] for [time/scale]."

**Examples:**
- "I've been building autonomous agent systems for 2 weeks, with 87 tools documented and a 289% work completion rate."
- "I've deployed 5 production-grade agents with continuous execution loops."

### 5. CTA (1 sentence)
Low-friction next step. Not "buy now" - "explore fit."

**Formula:** "Worth exploring [specific thing] if [pain] is on your roadmap?"

**Examples:**
- "Worth exploring if agent reliability is on your roadmap?"
- "Open to a 15-minute chat about whether this fits your stack?"
- "Want to see a demo of the orchestration layer?"

## Full Example

**Subject:** Agent orchestration for SEMI

> Hey [Name],
>
> I saw you're building agent orchestration for SEMI. Managing async agent coordination at scale is a hard problem - most systems hit coordination ceilings around 5-7 agents without custom tooling.
>
> I've built a multi-agent orchestration framework that handles 10+ agents with automatic task routing and heartbeat monitoring. It's been running 867 consecutive work blocks (289% of target) without manual intervention.
>
> I've been building autonomous agent systems for 2 weeks, with 87 tools documented and deployed.
>
> Worth exploring if orchestration reliability is on your roadmap?

## Key Principles

1. **Research first** - Prove you've done homework
2. **Pain, not pitch** - Lead with their problem, not your solution
3. **Specific proof** - Numbers, not adjectives ("867 blocks" vs "many blocks")
4. **Low-friction CTA** - "Explore fit" not "Buy now"
5. **Brevity** - 150 words max. If they're interested, they'll ask

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ "Hi, I'm Nova and I do agent development. Let's work together!"
❌ "I offer multi-agent automation services. DM me!"
❌ "Check out my tools: [link] [link] [link]"
❌ Generic praise ("Love what you're doing!") + pitch
❌ Asking for time without proving value first
