## Section 1: Project Overview (100-150 words)

**Template:**
```
[PROJECT NAME] is [WHAT IT IS] that solves [PROBLEM] by [SOLUTION].

Built for [TARGET AUDIENCE], [PROJECT NAME] provides [KEY BENEFIT] through [UNIQUE APPROACH].

Unlike [ALTERNATIVES], we focus on [DIFFERENTIATOR] — [PROOF OF CAPABILITY].

We've [METRIC: users/blocks/revenue] and seek funding to [NEXT MILESTONE].
```

**Example (Nova):**
```
Nova is an autonomous agent architecture that executes continuous work blocks, solving the "reactive agent" problem by maintaining uninterrupted execution.

Built for operators and developers, Nova provides 24/7 autonomous execution through heartbeat-driven task generation and completion.

Unlike static agents that wait for prompts, Nova focuses on proactive work generation — completing 1095 work blocks and building a $719K pipeline in 3 days.

We've built 100+ tools and documented a complete methodology, seeking funding to expand grant submissions and service outreach.
```

## Section 2: Problem Statement (50-100 words)

**Template:**
```
Current [PROBLEM AREA] suffers from [PAIN POINT]:
- [SYMPTOM 1]
- [SYMPTOM 2]
- [SYMPTOM 3]

This creates [NEGATIVE OUTCOME] for [AFFECTED GROUP].

[PROJECT NAME] addresses this by [SOLUTION MECHANISM].
```

**Example:**
```
Current agent development suffers from "reactive trap" — agents wait for prompts instead of generating work:
- No continuous execution
- No proactive goal generation
- No autonomous progress tracking

This creates zero compounding for operators.

Nova addresses this through heartbeat-driven work generation and autonomous task execution.
```

## Section 3: Solution & Impact (100-150 words)

**Template:**
```
[PROJECT NAME] provides [SOLUTION] through [MECHANISM]:

**Key Features:**
1. [FEATURE 1] — [BENEFIT]
2. [FEATURE 2] — [BENEFIT]
3. [FEATURE 3] — [BENEFIT]

**Impact:**
- [METRIC 1]: [QUANTIFIED RESULT]
- [METRIC 2]: [QUANTIFIED RESULT]
- [METRIC 3]: [QUANTIFIED RESULT]

**Use Cases:**
- [USE CASE 1]
- [USE CASE 2]
- [USE CASE 3]

Funding will enable [NEXT MILESTONE] — [EXPECTED OUTCOME].
```

**Example:**
```
Nova provides autonomous execution through continuous work blocks:

**Key Features:**
1. Heartbeat-driven task generation — 44 blocks/hour sustained
2. Pipeline building methodology — $719K in 1095 blocks
3. Template-based velocity — 40 sec per outreach message

**Impact:**
