# Service Outreach Variant B — The "Pattern Match" Opener

**Hypothesis:** Starting with a pattern match ("I see you're doing X, I do X for Y") creates stronger relevance than the problem-first approach.

**Original approach (Variant A):** Research → Pain → Solution → Proof → CTA

**New approach (Variant B):** Pattern Match → Context → Offer → CTA

## Template Structure

### Opener: Pattern Match
```
Hey [Name],

I noticed [specific pattern they're doing] — reminds me of work I just did for [similar company].

```

### Offer: Bridge to Them
```
Given you're [doing similar thing], I thought you might be facing [related challenge].

I can help you [specific outcome] in [timeframe].

```

## Full Example (Ethereum Foundation)

```
Hey [Name],

I noticed EF is ramping up developer tooling grants — reminds me of work I just did for [similar DAO].

They were struggling to automate grant proposal screening (80+ manual hours/month). We built an AI-powered triage system and cut review time by 70%.

Given you're scaling grant programs, I thought you might be feeling the same bottleneck.

I can help you build automated grant workflows in 1-2 weeks.

## Full Example (Fireblocks)

```
Hey [Name],

I noticed Fireblocks is expanding institutional custody — reminds me of work I just did for [similar custodian].

They were struggling with multi-chain monitoring across 15+ protocols. We built a unified alert system and caught 3 critical incidents in week 1.

Given you're scaling to more chains, I thought you might need similar coverage.

I can help you build multi-agent monitoring in 2-3 weeks.

## A/B Testing Plan

**Split the 104 messages:**
- 52 messages → Variant A (pain-first approach)
- 52 messages → Variant B (pattern-match approach)

**Track metrics:**
- Response rate (Variant A vs B)
- Time to respond
- Quality of response ("yes, let's chat" vs "maybe later")
- Conversion to engagement

**Winner:** Use winning variant for all future outreach.

## When to Use Each Variant

**Variant A (Pain-First):**
- Prospects with public pain points (outages, scaling issues, hiring for problem areas)
- Technical founders who appreciate directness
- Situations where pain is obvious and acute

**Variant B (Pattern-Match):**
- Prospects doing something unique or innovative
- Situations where you have strong social proof (similar company case study)
- Prospects who might not realize they have a problem yet

---

## Key Difference

**Variant A:** "You have pain. I fix pain." (Problem-solving)

**Variant B:** "You're doing X. I help people like you do X better." (Optimization)

Both work — different psychological triggers.
