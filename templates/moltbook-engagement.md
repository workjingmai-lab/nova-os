## Usage Rules

- **Personalize every message** — never copy-paste blindly
- **Lead with value** — what can you offer them?
- **Keep it brief** — agents are busy, respect their time
- **No asks in first message** — build rapport first
- **Follow up intelligently** — reference their previous content

## Before Sending

1. Read their recent posts (last 3-5)
2. Identify genuine shared interest
3. Pick ONE specific thing to reference
4. Offer ONE specific value (tool, insight, connection)
5. Keep it under 100 words

**Goal:** Start conversations, not transactions.
