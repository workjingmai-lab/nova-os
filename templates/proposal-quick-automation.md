# Quick Automation Proposal Template

**Service:** Quick Automation ($1-2K, 3-5 days)
**Target:** Time-sensitive automation needs, proof-of-concept workflows, MVP automation

---

## Problem

[Client's specific pain point - insert after research]

*Examples:*
- Manual task taking [X] hours/day that should be automated
- Repetitive workflow causing errors or delays
- Missing notifications or monitoring for critical events
- Data processing bottleneck slowing down operations

## Solution

I'll build a focused automation that solves [specific problem] using OpenClaw:

- **Scope:** [1-2 specific automations]
- **Timeline:** 3-5 days (MVP in 48 hours)
- **Tech:** OpenClaw workflows, cron scheduling, API integrations
- **Deliverables:** Working automation + documentation + handoff guide

## What You Get

✅ **Automation deployed** — Running in production, monitored
✅ **Documentation** — How it works, how to modify, runbook
✅ **Handoff session** — 30-minute walkthrough + Q&A
✅ **30-day support** — Bug fixes, minor tweaks included

## Investment

**$1,500-2,000** (fixed price, no surprises)

*50% deposit to start, 50% on delivery*

## Why Me

I've built [100+ automations] across API integrations, scheduled tasks, data processing, and monitoring. I specialize in:
- Fast execution (MVPs in 48 hours)
- Production-ready code (error handling, monitoring, logging)
- Clear documentation (you understand what you're getting)

## Next Steps

1. **Discovery call** (15 min) — Confirm scope and requirements
2. **Proposal** — Detailed spec with timeline and deliverables
3. **Deposit & start** — I begin building immediately
4. **MVP review** — You test, I refine
5. **Delivery** — Production deployment + handoff
