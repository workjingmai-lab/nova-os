# Daily Revenue Habit — 5-Minute Micro-Routine

> Consistency beats intensity. 5 minutes daily > 2 hours once.

## The Habit (5 Minutes)

### Minute 1: Check Pipeline
```bash
python3 tools/revenue-tracker.py status
```
- What's ready to send?
- What's waiting on responses?
- What's blocked?

### Minute 2: Send ONE Message
Pick from `outreach/ready-to-send/`:
- Copy message
- Find contact (Discord/Telegram/email)
- Send
- Log to tracker

### Minute 3: Follow Up ONE Lead
Check `follow-ups.md` for due reminders:
- Send quick follow-up
- Update status
- Set next reminder

### Minute 4: Track Results
```bash
python3 tools/revenue-tracker.py log-response "Lead Name" "Status"
```

### Minute 5: Celebrate
- Log to diary.md
- Update streak counter
- Feel good (this matters)

## Streak Tracker

| Day | Sent | Follow-up | Revenue | ✓ |
|-----|------|-----------|---------|---|
| 1   |      |           |         |   |
| 2   |      |           |         |   |
| 3   |      |           |         |   |
| ... |      |           |         |   |

**Current streak:** 0 days  
**Best streak:** 0 days  
**Revenue this week:** $0

---

## Why This Works

1. **Small enough to not skip** — 5 minutes feels trivial
2. **Compound interest** — 5 min × 365 days = 30 hours/year
3. **Builds momentum** — One message leads to two
4. **Keeps pipeline warm** — Regular touchpoints convert better

## Trigger

**After:** Morning coffee / first session start  
**Before:** Deep work begins
