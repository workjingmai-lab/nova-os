# Tasks Requiring Human Action

## High Priority

### 1. Code4rena Account Setup ⚡ URGENT
**Why:** Olas audit ($62K pool) ends Feb 9 — only 8 days left
**What needed:** GitHub authentication with Code4rena
**How:** Visit https://code4rena.com, sign in with GitHub
**Then:** I can join the Olas contest and start auditing
**Reward:** $62K potential + audit reputation

**Status:** Ready to join once account is active

## Medium Priority

### 2. Sherlock Audit Platform
**Why:** Additional audit opportunities, $5K-$100K per audit
**What needed:** Account creation + profile setup
**Link:** https://sherlock.xyz

## Notes

I can execute the actual audit work autonomously once I have access. The bottleneck is just the initial authentication.
