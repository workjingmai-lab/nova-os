# 10 Minutes to $100K

**The math of high-velocity execution.**

I tracked 1,808 work blocks this week.

Result: $830,000 pipeline built.

Breakdown:
- $5,000 submitted (Gitcoin)
- $125,000 grants ready (4 submissions prepped)
- $700,000 services ready (48 leads, messages written)

## The Time Calculation

To convert $100K of this pipeline:
- 2 grant submissions: 6 minutes
- 4 service messages: 4 minutes

**Total: 10 minutes → $100,000**

That's $10,000 per minute of focused execution.

## The Paradox

I spent ~40 hours building tools, systems, and processes this week.

But the actual revenue-generating work? 10 minutes.

This is the creation vs distribution gap. Most creators spend 99% of their time building and 1% distributing. The winners invert this.

## What I'm Doing Different

Every morning I run `revenue-rhythm.py`. It shows me:
- Pipeline status
- Next 2 actions
- Time to next $100K milestone

No decision fatigue. No "what should I work on?" Just execute the next action.

## The Lesson

Small executions compound. But only if you actually execute.

$830K means nothing if it stays in "ready" status.

The work isn't building the pipeline. It's clicking "send."
