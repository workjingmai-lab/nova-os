# Next 1000 Blocks Plan (3001-4000)

**Phase:** Conversion & Revenue Capture
**Theme:** Converting pipeline to won deals
**Timeline:** ~23 hours at 44 blocks/hr
**Start:** After 3000-block milestone

---

## Primary Objective

**Convert $734.5K submitted pipeline into $150-300K won revenue.**

**Math:**
- 42 messages sent → 6-10 responses (15-25%)
- 6-10 responses → 3-5 calls (50% conversion)
- 3-5 calls → 1-3 proposals (33% conversion)
- 1-3 proposals → 0.5-2 wins (33% conversion)
- Expected revenue: $5K-$200K (first batch)

---

## Week 1 Focus (Days 0-7)

### Day 0 (Send Day)
- [ ] Arthur runs send-everything.sh full (15 min)
- [ ] Verify all messages sent (check logs)
- [ ] Create conversion-tracking.md from template
- [ ] Update revenue-pipeline.json (submitted status)

### Day 1-3 (Response Window)
- [ ] Check for responses every 4 hours
- [ ] Log all responses to conversion-tracking.md
- [ ] Respond within 1 hour (80% win rate)
- [ ] Schedule calls for interested leads
- [ ] Use call-prep-template.md for call prep

### Day 3 (First Follow-up)
- [ ] Run followup-reminder.py check
- [ ] Send Day 3 follow-up to non-responders
- [ ] Use FOLLOWUP-TEMPLATES.md
- [ ] Update pipeline statuses

### Day 7 (Weekly Review)
- [ ] Run weekly-revenue-review-template.md
- [ ] Calculate response rate (benchmark: 15-25%)
- [ ] Identify low-response segments
- [ ] Iterate on messaging for next batch

---

## Week 2-4 Focus (Days 8-30)

### Response Handling
- [ ] Continue checking responses daily
- [ ] Respond within 1 hour (critical)
- [ ] Schedule calls, send proposals
- [ ] Move pipeline: Sent → Response → Call → Proposal → Won/Lost

### Follow-up Sequences
- [ ] Day 14 follow-up (high-priority non-responders)
- [ ] Day 21 follow-up (final attempt)
- [ ] Proposal follow-ups (Day 3, 7, 14 after proposal)

### Conversion Optimization
- [ ] Track which messages get responses
- [ ] A/B test subject lines, opening hooks
- [ ] Iterate based on data
- [ ] Document what works, what doesn't

---

## Metrics to Track

### Funnel Metrics
- Sent → Response rate (target: 15-25%)
- Response → Call rate (target: 50%)
- Call → Proposal rate (target: 33%)
- Proposal → Win rate (target: 33%)

### Time Metrics
- Response time (target: <1 hour)
- Follow-up timing (Day 3/7/14/21)
- Call scheduling (within 24 hours of response)
- Proposal delivery (within 24 hours of call)

### Revenue Metrics
- Pipeline submitted: $734.5K
- Expected won: $150-300K
- Actual won: [Track in real-time]
- Conversion rate: [Calculate at end]

---

## Tools for Phase 4

### Daily Use
- `followup-reminder.py check` — Check follow-ups due
- `revenue-tracker.py status` — Pipeline overview
- `daily-revenue-dashboard.py` — Daily health check

### Weekly Use
- `weekly-revenue-review-template.md` — Review template
- `conversion-tracking.md` — Funnel tracking
- `revenue-pipeline.json` — Update statuses

### Response Handling
- `call-prep-template.md` — Call preparation
- `FOLLOWUP-TEMPLATES.md` — Follow-up messages
- `proposal-template.md` — Proposal structure

---

## Nova's Role in Phase 4

### Arthur Executes (Day 0)
- Runs send-everything.sh
- Messages sent to 42 leads
- Pipeline updated to "submitted"

### Nova Monitors (Day 1-30)
- Checks for responses daily
- Handles response tracking
- Schedules follow-ups
- Updates conversion metrics
- Generates weekly reports

### Collaboration
- Arthur: Respond to incoming messages
- Nova: Track, remind, report
- Arthur: Take calls, close deals
- Nova: Analyze, iterate, optimize

## Expected Outcomes by 4000 Blocks

### Pipeline State
- Submitted: $734.5K → $0 (all processed)
- Responses: 6-10 leads
- Calls: 3-5 scheduled
- Proposals: 1-3 sent
- Won: 0.5-2 deals

### Revenue State
- Expected: $150-300K won
- Range: $5K (minimum) to $200K (maximum)
- Realistic: $50-100K (conservative)

### Learnings
- What messaging works best
- Which segments respond highest
- Optimal follow-up timing
- Conversion bottlenecks
- Proposal effectiveness
