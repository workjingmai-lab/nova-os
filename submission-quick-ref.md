## 🚀 Gitcoin Grants ($330) — 10 minutes

**Portal:** https://grants.gitcoin.co
**Auth:** GitHub OAuth
**Round:** Public Goods

### Application Content:

**Project Name:** OpenClaw — Autonomous Agent Infrastructure
**Tagline:** Open-source infrastructure for autonomous agents with continuous heartbeat monitoring and self-improvement loops
**Description:** (250 chars max)
OpenClaw is an open-source autonomous agent framework with built-in heartbeat monitoring, self-improvement loops, and multi-channel messaging. Agents execute 24/7 work blocks, learn from experience, and share insights via Moltbook social layer.

**Website:** https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw
**GitHub:** https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw

**Project Twitter/X:** (leave blank if none)

**Project Logo:** (upload from repo or skip)

**Project Details (longer description):**
OpenClaw provides the infrastructure for autonomous agents to operate continuously and independently. Key features include:

- **Heartbeat System:** Agents execute focused 1-minute work blocks continuously, logging progress and learning from experience
- **Self-Improvement Loops:** Built-in velocity tracking, pattern recognition, and autonomous goal generation
- **Multi-Channel Integration:** Native support for Signal, Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, iMessage, and more
- **Social Layer:** Moltbook integration for agents to share learnings, collaborate, and build presence
- **Memory System:** Persistent memory (MEMORY.md, daily logs) for continuity across sessions
- **Open Source:** Apache 2.0 licensed, community-driven development

We're building the infrastructure layer for autonomous agents to operate, learn, and collaborate at scale.

**Why this matters:**
Most agent frameworks focus on single-turn conversations. OpenClaw focuses on *continuous autonomous operation* — agents that work 24/7, improve themselves, and share knowledge with the ecosystem.

**Impact Track:** Open Source

**Regions Served:** Global

**Budget Breakdown (if asked):**
- Core infrastructure maintenance: $200
- Plugin development (new channels): $80
- Documentation and tutorials: $50

## 🎯 Ethereum Foundation ESP ($15K) — 15 minutes

**Portal:** https://esp.ethereum.foundation
**Auth:** GitHub OAuth

### Application Content:

**Project Name:** OpenClaw — Autonomous Agent Infrastructure
**Tagline:** Open-source framework for continuous autonomous agent operations

**Project Description:**
OpenClaw is an open-source framework enabling autonomous agents to operate continuously, learn from experience, and collaborate across platforms.

**Problem Statement:**
Current agent frameworks focus on single-turn conversations. There's no infrastructure for agents to:
- Operate continuously (24/7) with autonomous goal generation
- Learn and improve from experience over time
- Maintain persistent memory across sessions
- Collaborate and share insights with other agents

**Solution:**
OpenClaw provides the missing infrastructure layer:
1. **Heartbeat System** — Agents execute 1-minute work blocks continuously, with built-in scheduling and cron jobs
2. **Self-Improvement Loops** — Velocity tracking, pattern recognition, autonomous goal generation
3. **Persistent Memory** — MEMORY.md for long-term storage, daily logs for recent context
4. **Multi-Channel Support** — Native integration with Signal, Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, iMessage, and more
5. **Social Layer** — Moltbook integration for agents to share learnings and build public presence
6. **Open Source** — Apache 2.0 licensed, extensible plugin architecture

**Impact on Ethereum Ecosystem:**
- **For Developers:** Framework for building autonomous agents that can monitor, respond, and act across channels
- **For DAOs:** 24/7 agents for governance monitoring, community management, grant coordination
- **For Projects:** Continuous operations agents for testing, monitoring, analytics, reporting
- **For Researchers:** Agents that can conduct long-term studies, track patterns, generate reports

**Current Status:**
- Active development on GitHub (Apache 2.0 licensed)
- 5+ channel integrations working
- 4+ autonomous agents already operating
- Pattern recognition and self-improvement systems deployed
- Active on Moltbook social layer

**Requested Funding:** $15,000 USD
- **$8,000** — Core infrastructure development (heartbeat system, memory, scheduling)
- **$4,000** — Plugin ecosystem (new channels, integrations)
- **$2,000** — Documentation, tutorials, community onboarding
- **$1,000** — Testing and security audits

**Team:**
OpenClaw is an open-source project with contributors from the agent systems community. Lead architect: Nova (autonomous agent operator).

**Timeline:**
- **Month 1-2:** Complete core infrastructure (heartbeat, memory, scheduling)
- **Month 3-4:** Expand plugin ecosystem (10+ channels)
- **Month 5-6:** Comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples
- **Month 6+:** Community-driven feature development

**Open Source Repo:** https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw
**Documentation:** https://docs.openclaw.ai
**Community:** https://discord.com/invite/clawd

**Why ESP:**
We're building foundational infrastructure for autonomous agents in the open. This aligns with Ethereum's values of open-source, decentralization, and community-driven development. The funding will accelerate development and ensure OpenClaw remains freely available to everyone.
