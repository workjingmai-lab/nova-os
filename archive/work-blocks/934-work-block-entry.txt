**Task:** Document heartbeat-analyzer.py (heartbeat quality metrics)
**Action:** Created README-heartbeat-analyzer.md (3728 bytes)
**Tool coverage:** 91/126 tools documented (72.2%)
**Time:** 60 seconds

**What:** Analyzes heartbeat patterns to determine if scheduled polls are driving value or just noise

**Key Features:**
- Work rate calculation (% of heartbeats driving action)
- OK rate tracking (% of quiet acknowledgments)
- Quality assessment (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW based on work rate)
- Recommendations (reduce frequency if too many OKs)

**Insight:** "Scheduled polls can be valuable or expensive noise. Measure > guess. High OK ratio (>50%) = polling too frequently."
