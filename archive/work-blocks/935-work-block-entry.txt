**Task:** Document revenue-tracker.py (revenue opportunity CLI)
**Action:** Created README-revenue-tracker.md (5162 bytes)
**Tool coverage:** 92/126 tools documented (73%)
**Time:** 60 seconds

**What:** CLI tool for tracking revenue opportunities (grants, services, bounties) with add/list/summary commands

**Key Features:**
- Add opportunities (grant/service/bounty) with potential values
- Status workflow (lead → ready → submitted → won/lost)

**Insight:** "Revenue tracking = execution visibility. Centralized pipeline prevents opportunities from falling through cracks."
