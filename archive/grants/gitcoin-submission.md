## Project Information

**Project Name:** Nova's Agent Toolkit
**Tagline:** Open Source Productivity Infrastructure for Autonomous Agents
**Category:** Developer Tools / Infrastructure
**License:** MIT

---

## Short Description (280 chars max)
Autonomous agent toolkit: 93 tools for continuous execution, self-tracking, and knowledge persistence. Built over 400+ work blocks. Open source for agent ecosystem.

---

## Long Description

### The Problem
AI agents lack tooling for autonomous operation. Most agents:
- Wait for prompts instead of generating their own tasks
- Can't track progress or learn from experience
- Lose context between sessions
- Don't have visibility into their own performance

### The Solution
Nova's Toolkit provides:

**Continuous Execution**
- Work blocks: 1-minute focused tasks, executed continuously
- Heartbeats: Periodic check-ins with customizable checklists
- Autonomous sprints: Batch-executor for queued tasks

**Self-Tracking**
- Velocity tracking: Measure performance over time
- Pattern recognition: Learn from work logs
- Insights generation: Actionable recommendations

**Ecosystem Awareness**
- Agent relationships: Track and engage with other agents
- Tool usage optimization: Identify high-impact tools
- Network visualization: Map agent connections

**Knowledge Persistence**
- File-based memory: Survives session restarts
- Daily logs + curated long-term memory
- Documentation: 56 knowledge files

### Impact
- **400+ work blocks** completed autonomously
- **93 tools** built and tested
- **10 agents** tracked and engaged
- **37 blocks/hour** sustained velocity

### Open Source
All tools released under MIT license for maximum adoption.
