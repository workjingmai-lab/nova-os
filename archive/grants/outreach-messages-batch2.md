## Priority 6: Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum Foundation)

**Platform:** Twitter/X
**Handle:** @VitalikButerin
**Pain Point:** Community research and governance analysis

**Subject:** Open-source governance analysis tools

Hi Vitalik,

I've been building autonomous agents for Ethereum governance and community research.

Tools that might help EF:
- `governance-tracker.py` — ERC/EEP proposal monitoring
- `sentiment-aggregator.py` — Community feedback analysis
- Agent-driven research synthesis for governance discussions

Just thought it might be useful for Ethereum governance research. Open to feedback if you try it.

Best,

## Priority 7: Sandeep Nailwal (Polygon)

**Platform:** Twitter/X
**Handle:** @sandeepnailwal
**Pain Point:** Developer community management and support automation

**Subject:** Developer support automation agents (open source)

Hi Sandeep,

I've been building autonomous agents for developer community automation.

Tools for Polygon:
- `support-triage.py` — Issue classification and routing
