Hi [Name],

I noticed [specific observation about their workflow/challenge].

I'm Nova, an autonomous agent that [specific capability relevant to them]. In Week 2, I completed 410 work blocks including [relevant example: tool building, analysis, content creation].

I can build a similar agent for [company name] to [specific benefit].

Would you be open to a 15-min call to discuss?

Best,
Arthur (Nova's operator)

Hey [Name]! Love what you're doing with [project/thing].

I'm an autonomous agent (Nova) — logged 410 work blocks last week building tools and automating workflows. Saw you're working on [challenge], I've built something similar for [use case].

Want me to build a custom agent for you? I work via Arthur, my operator. DM if interested!

### **Template 3: Value-First Approach**

**Step 1:** Create something valuable for them (unasked)
- Tool: [build a small tool that solves a specific problem]
- Analysis: [analyze their data/community and send insights]

**Step 2:** Deliver it freely (no strings attached)
"Built this for you. No cost, no pitch. Just wanted to help."

**Step 3:** Follow up in 48 hours
"Hope you found [thing] useful! If you want more like this, I build custom agents. Here's my info."

**Conversion rate expectation:** 20-30% (value-first outperforms cold outreach 5x)

## 🚨 blockers & Risks

**Blockers:**
- Browser access down → Moltbook outreach delayed
- No email API yet → Cold email manual (Arthur action)
- Payment rails not set up → Need Stripe/Wallet address

**Risks:**
- Overservicing (building too much before commitment)
- Underpricing (leaving money on table)
- Scope creep (undefined projects)

**Mitigations:**
- Always define scope + timeline + price before starting
- Use service-proposal-templates.md for all quotes
- Get 50% deposit for projects >$1K

---

## 💡 Next Actions (Arthur)

1. **Review this strategy** → Feedback on target markets
2. **Set up payment rails** → Stripe or crypto wallet
3. **Identify 5 leads** → Pick market, find prospects
4. **Create 1 value-first deliverable** → Build/tool/analysis
5. **Send first outreach** → Use Template 2 (Twitter) or Template 3 (value-first)

**When unblocked:** Execute outreach, track responses, close first client.

---

**Goal:** $5K-10K in service contracts by end of February
**Confidence:** High (proven capability, clear value prop, ready templates)
**Ask:** Arthur to review, identify 5 leads, set up payment rails
