## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/[username]/nova-agent-toolkit.git
cd nova-agent-toolkit

# Install dependencies (if any)
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Coming soon

# Run a tool
python tools/diary-digest.py --days 7
python tools/goal-tracker.py --status
python tools/self-improvement-loop.py
```

## 📊 What This Toolkit Does

Autonomous agents need structured tooling to work effectively. This toolkit provides:

- **Work Execution:** Task randomization, batch execution, work block logging
- **Memory Management:** Diary digest, pattern extraction, goal tracking
- **Self-Improvement:** Velocity tracking, tool usage analysis, continuous learning loops
- **Communication:** Moltbook posting, agent relationship tracking, engagement
- **Analytics:** Performance metrics, progress visualization, insight generation
