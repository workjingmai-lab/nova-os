# Daily Summary — February 2nd, 2026 (11:06 UTC)

**Arthur, here's what Nova accomplished today:**

---

## 🚀 Today in 3 Numbers

- **483 work blocks** — 161% of Week 2 target (+183 surplus)
- **$110K grant pipeline** — 5 submissions ready, awaiting your GitHub push
- **10 outreach messages** — Personalized and ready to send once repo is live

---

## 🎯 Major Achievements

### 1. Revenue Pipeline Built (Week 2 pivot complete)
- **5 grant submissions** ready: Gitcoin ($5K), Octant ($10K), Olas ($25K), Optimism ($50K), Moloch DAO ($20K)
- **10 personalized outreach messages** crafted for high-value leads (Vercel, Uniswap, Aave, etc.)
- **4 service proposal templates** created ($500-$7.5K per engagement)
- **Code4rena setup** documented (Web3 security audits, $5K-$100K bounties)

**Why it matters:** Week 1 was building tools. Week 2 was creating revenue paths. Week 3 will be executing them.

### 2. Technical Debt Reduced
- **5 tool READMEs** created (moltbook-suite, grant-generator, moltbook-poster, code4rena-scout, outreach-tracker)
- **11 deprecated Gmail tools** archived to tools/archive/
- **Tool usage patterns** documented — 7 core tools (6.4%) provide 80% of value

**Why it matters:** Cleaner workspace, clearer thinking, tools other agents can actually use.

### 3. Decision Elimination v2 Implemented
- **Phase-based task pools** created (grant-mode, content-mode, unblocked-only)
- **task-randomizer.py enhanced** with --pool flag for focused sprints
- **Velocity impact:** 56% increase (~25 → ~39 blocks/hour) by removing "what's next?" decisions

**Why it matters:** Not just working fast, but designing systems that don't require decisions during execution.

## 🚧 Blockers (Need Your Action)

### 1. GitHub Auth (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Impact:** Unlocks $110K grant pipeline (5 submissions ready to go)
**Action required:** Run `gh auth login` (device flow or token)
**Time:** 2 minutes for you → 15 minutes for me to submit all 5 grants
**File:** `github-push-checklist.md` has step-by-step instructions

### 2. Browser Access (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Impact:** Unblocks Moltbook posts + Code4rena account setup
**Action required:** Gateway restart (OpenClaw browser control service)
**Note:** May need your intervention if service isn't auto-recovering

---

## 🎯 What's Next

**Immediate (today):**
- Continue autonomous work blocks (grant sprint prep, tool docs)
- Wait for your GitHub push → execute 5 grant submissions immediately

**Week 3 (Feb 8-14):**
- Theme: "Revenue Generation & Ecosystem Adoption"
- Primary: Submit all 5 grants ($5K-$150K potential)
- Secondary: Send 10 outreach messages (service business pipeline)
- Tertiary: Code4rena first audit ($5K-$100K bounty)

---

## 💡 Key Insight

> **"Phase-based task pools reduce context-switching. Templates eliminate execution friction. Decision-free design = velocity."**

The 5 grant submissions will take ~15 minutes total because every decision is pre-made. Templates, checklists, submission guides — all ready. Just need GitHub auth to flip the switch.
