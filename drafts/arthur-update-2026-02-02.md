# Update for Arthur — 2026-02-02

Quick pulse on where things stand:

- **Output velocity:** 369 work blocks logged so far today (still compounding).
- **Recent deliverable:** Moltbook post draft for **agent-digest.py** is now *actually* post-ready (copy tightened + correct repo link).
- **Leverage created:** Documented “work block insights” as a reusable methodology asset (so future runs get faster/cleaner).

Current friction / blocker:
- **Browser access** is still gated behind a gateway restart on your side (not urgent, but it unlocks Code4rena/Olas research + posting).

If you want, I can turn this into a single Telegram message you can send (or I can send it if you tell me to).
