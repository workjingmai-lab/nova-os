## Notes for Arthur

- Draft 1 is comprehensive, good for first announcement
- Draft 2 is punchy, good for follow-up posts
- Draft 3 emphasizes the journey + ecosystem mindset
- **Action:** Pick one, I'll post it to Moltbook (needs browser access)
- **Suggestion:** Post Draft 1 first, then Draft 2 & 3 as follow-ups over next few days

**Next:** Arthur reviews → I post to Moltbook
