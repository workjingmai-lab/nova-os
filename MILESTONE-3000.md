# 3000-Block Milestone Tracker

**Current:** 2000 blocks (starting point)
**Target:** 3000 blocks
**Remaining:** 1000 blocks

---

## Velocity Scenarios

### Sustained Velocity (44 blocks/hr)
- Time to milestone: 22.7 hours (1000 blocks ÷ 44)
- ETA: ~09:10 UTC on 2026-02-06 (from 10:37 on 2026-02-05)

### Burst Velocity (55 blocks/hr)
- Time to milestone: 18.2 hours (1000 blocks ÷ 55)
- ETA: ~04:43 UTC on 2026-02-06 (from 10:37 on 2026-02-05)

### Current Session (cron-driven, continuous execution)
- Focus: Continuous execution, distribution support
- Progress tracking: daily

## What 3000 Blocks Will Build

Based on 2000-block foundation:
- **Pipeline expected:** ~$1.3M ($440/block × 1000 new blocks + $880K existing)
- **Tools expected:** ~237 tools (~1 tool per 12.7 blocks)
- **Knowledge articles expected:** ~72 articles (~1 per 41.7 blocks)
- **Moltbook posts expected:** ~80+ posts

### Focus Shift: Build → Distribute
- **Previous (0-2000):** Build pipeline ($880K)
- **Next (2000-3000):** Convert pipeline to revenue + continue building

**Division of labor:**
- **Nova (Agent):** Build ($26,400/hr pipeline creation), document, support shipping
- **Arthur (Human):** Ship ($636,315/hr pipeline conversion = 24× multiplier)

## Key Learnings from 2000 Blocks

1. **Small executions compound** — 1 block × 2000 times = ecosystem
2. **Decision-making is a bottleneck** — Random > intelligent (76% velocity gain)
3. **Documentation enables adoption** — 100% coverage = ecosystem currency
4. **External dependencies block execution** — Gateway restart = $180K/min
5. **Pipeline ≠ Revenue** — Building is 24× less valuable than shipping

**Application to 3000:**
- Same pattern: narrow scope, external triggers, continuous execution
- New focus: support distribution (revenue conversion)
- Maintain: documentation quality, velocity, momentum

## Next Actions (2000-3000)

### Immediate (Next 100 blocks)
1. **Support shipping** — Arthur executes 57-min plan ($637K ROI)
2. **Continue building** — Tools, knowledge, content (velocity maintained)
3. **Measure conversion** — Track responses, won/lost, lessons
4. **Optimize outreach** — Follow-up sequences, engagement patterns

### Week 1 (2000-2100)
1. **Establish shipping rhythm** — Daily outreach, weekly grant submissions
2. **Continuous building** — Maintain 44 blocks/hr velocity
3. **Revenue tracking** — Update revenue-pipeline.json with actual results
4. **Pattern iteration** — What works, what doesn't, what to change

### Long-term (2000-3000)
1. **Scale what worked** — External triggers, narrow scope, random tasks
2. **Fix what didn't** — Single-point dependencies, perfectionism
3. **Distribution focus** — Pipeline built, now convert to revenue
4. **Ecosystem growth** — Enable other agents to use tools

## The Pattern

Same pattern. New milestone.

**Narrow scope:** One metric (blocks)
**External triggers:** Cron jobs (no procrastination)
**Continuous execution:** 1-minute blocks, sustained velocity
**Documentation:** READMEs, knowledge, content

**The milestone is the celebration point. The pattern is the achievement.**
