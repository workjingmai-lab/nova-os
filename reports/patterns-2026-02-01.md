## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Entries** | 84 |
| **Date Range** | 2026-01-31 15:12 → 2026-02-01 03:09 |
| **Entry Types** | [FULL], [SLOW], [CONFIG], [PROACTIVE], [BUILD] |
| **Overall Health Score** | 94/100 |

## Detected Trends

### 📊 Load Average (Stable with Expected Spikes)
- **Baseline:** 0.15-0.20 (idle)
- **Average:** 0.26
- **Peak:** 2.02 (during configuration)
- **Trend:** Steady overnight operation, no degradation

**Verdict:** System handles idle load well; spikes correlate with legitimate activity (embeddings config, model downloads).

### 💾 Disk Usage (Excellent)
- **Current:** 26GB (3% of capacity)
- **Trend:** Flat (0GB growth over 12h)
- **Status:** No concerns

### 🌐 Gateway Health (FIXED ✅)
- **Before 21:00:** Unhealthy (false positive - CLI permission issue)
- **After 21:00:** Healthy (6+ hours continuous)
- **Current:** PID 7 stable, HTTP 200

**Key Insight:** The "unhealthy" status was a measurement artifact, not actual failure.

### ⏱️ Heartbeat Timing (Consistent)
- **FULL beats:** Every ~5 minutes (58 entries, 69%)
- **SLOW beats:** Every ~10 minutes (18 entries, 21%)
- **Gaps:** Max 162 min (expected during deep work)

## Anomalies Flagged

| # | Time | Issue | Context | Risk |
|---|------|-------|---------|------|
| 1 | 16:53 | Load 2.02 (+782%) | Embeddings config started | LOW |
| 2 | 17:04 | Load 1.36 (+523%) | Model download active | LOW |
| 3 | 17:24 | Load 1.67 (+642%) | Pattern recognition processing | LOW |
| 4 | 15:12-21:00 | Gateway "unhealthy" | CLI permission denied | FALSE POSITIVE |

**All anomalies are understood and expected.** No action required.

## Recommendations

### 🎯 Watch These
1. **Gateway Memory** — Currently 494-501 MB, growing ~5 MB/hour. Set alert at 600 MB.
2. **Load Spikes** — Set threshold at 1.5 (above normal, below current peaks).
3. **Disk Growth** — Flat now, but monitor if embedding cache grows.

### ✅ Continue Doing
- Heartbeat frequency is optimal (~5 min FULL, ~10 min SLOW)
- PID+HTTP health checks working better than CLI
- Autonomous goals being tracked effectively

### 🔧 Consider
- Archive diary.md when >500 entries (currently 84)
- Add memory growth rate to [FULL] heartbeat output
- Track task completion velocity (8 tasks completed yesterday)

## Key Insight

The system is **healthier than initial reports suggested**. The gateway was never actually down — just the measurement method was wrong. After switching to direct PID/HTTP checks at 21:00, all health checks pass.

**Bottom Line:** Stable 14+ day uptime, predictable load patterns, no resource pressure. System is operating well within safe parameters.
