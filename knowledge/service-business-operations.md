# Service Business Operations

## The Problem

Service businesses fail at execution, not sales.

Great sales pitch → client says yes → **delivery is a mess** → unhappy client → no referral → no repeat business.

**The gap:** Closing deals ≠ fulfilling deals. You need operations.

## The Solution

**Standardized workflows for every phase of service delivery.**

From discovery call to project handoff, every step is documented, repeatable, and scalable.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery (Day 1)

### Objective
Understand the client's problem, confirm scope is a fit, set expectations.

### Checklist
- [ ] **Pre-call research** (15 min)
  - Read their site, blog, GitHub
  - Identify their tech stack
  - Find specific pain points to mention

- [ ] **Discovery call** (30 min)
  - Client describes problem (listen 80%, talk 20%)
  - Ask: "What does this task cost you now?" (quantify pain)
  - Ask: "What happens if this doesn't get fixed?" (urgency)
  - Confirm: "Can I solve this in 3-5 days?" (scope fit)

- [ ] **Follow-up email** (same day)
  - Summary of problem discussed
  - Proposed solution (high-level)
  - Next steps: detailed spec or deposit

### Red Flags (Walk Away)
- "I need this tomorrow" → Unrealistic timeline
- "Budget is $500" → Wrong price bracket
- "I don't know what I want" → Not ready to buy
- "Can you add X, Y, Z?" → Scope creep starting

### Green Flags (Proceed)
- "This is exactly our problem" → Pain confirmed
- "How soon can you start?" → Urgency confirmed
- "Budget is flexible for the right solution" → Price fit
- "Can you also help with X later?" → Upsell potential

## Phase 2: Specification (Day 2)

### Objective
Create a clear spec that both sides understand. No ambiguity.

### Template

**Project: [Name]**

**Problem:**
[Client's specific pain point]

**Solution:**
[What you'll build, how it'll work]

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Deliverable 1 (e.g., Working automation deployed)
- [ ] Deliverable 2 (e.g., Documentation)
- [ ] Deliverable 3 (e.g., Handoff session)

**Timeline:**
- Day 1-2: Discovery and spec (today)
- Day 3-4: Build and test
- Day 5: Delivery and handoff

**Investment:** $1,500-2,000 (50% deposit to start)

**What's NOT included:**
- [ ] Out-of-scope features (be explicit)
- [ ] Ongoing maintenance (unless retainer)
- [ ] Training beyond handoff session

**Next Steps:**
1. Review spec
2. Approve or request changes
3. Send deposit (50%)
4. Project starts

### Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Vague scope: "We'll figure it out as we go" → Scope creep
- ❌ Missing timeline: "It'll be done when it's done" → Anxiety
- ❌ No boundaries: "Sure, we can add that" → Margin erosion

### Best Practices
- ✅ Explicit deliverables: "Working automation" not "Help with automation"
- ✅ Clear timeline: "Day 5 delivery" not "ASAP"
- ✅ Hard boundaries: "Not included: X, Y, Z" prevents scope creep

---

## Phase 3: Execution (Days 3-4)

### Objective
Build the solution, test thoroughly, document everything.

### Daily Routine

**Morning (Day 3):**
- [ ] Review spec one more time
- [ ] Break into 3-5 tasks
- [ ] Estimate time for each task
- [ ] Start building

**Afternoon (Day 3):**
- [ ] Complete core functionality
- [ ] Initial testing (happy path)
- [ ] Document edge cases to test

**Morning (Day 4):**
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Fix bugs
- [ ] Prepare handoff documentation

**Afternoon (Day 4):**
- [ ] Final testing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Ready for delivery

### Communication Protocol
- **Day 3 mid-day check-in:** "Started build, on track for Day 5 delivery"
- **Day 4 end-of-day update:** "Testing complete, ready for handoff tomorrow"
- **No news:** If client doesn't respond, keep going (don't block)

### Quality Standards
- [ ] Code is clean and commented
- [ ] Edge cases handled (not just happy path)
- [ ] Error messages are helpful
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive

### Documentation Template

**Project Handoff: [Name]**

**What was built:**
[High-level description]

**How it works:**
[Technical overview]

**How to use:**
[Step-by-step instructions]

**How to modify:**
[Code structure, where to make changes]

**Troubleshooting:**
- Error A → Solution A
- Error B → Solution B

**Contact:**
Questions? Reply to this email or [contact method]

## Phase 4: Delivery (Day 5)

### Objective
Deliver the solution, train the client, ensure satisfaction.

### Delivery Checklist
- [ ] **Send deliverables** (Day 5 morning)
  - Working solution deployed
  - Documentation attached
  - Handoff session scheduled

- [ ] **Handoff session** (30 min, Day 5 afternoon)
  - Live demo of solution
  - Walk through documentation
  - Answer questions
  - Ask: "Is there anything else you need?"

- [ ] **Follow-up email** (same day)
  - Thanks for working together
  - Project summary
  - Ask for testimonial (if happy)
  - Open door for future work

### Upsell Setup
During handoff, plant seeds:
- "This solves [current problem]. Have you thought about [related problem]?"
- "We could extend this to [larger scope]. Want to explore?"
- "Want me to monitor/maintain this? I offer retainers."

### Testimonial Request
**Only if client is happy:**
"Quick favor: If you're happy with this, would you write a 2-3 sentence testimonial? Just:
- What problem you had
- What I built
- How it's helping now

Nothing fancy. I use these to help other prospects understand what I do."

---

## Phase 5: Post-Delivery (Weeks 2-4)

### Objective
Ensure satisfaction, request referrals, identify upsell opportunities.

### Week 1 Check-In
"Hey [Name], checking in — how's [project] working? Any questions or tweaks?"

**Goal:** Confirm satisfaction, fix small issues (builds trust).

### Week 2 Check-In
"Hope [project] is still going well. Quick question: Have you thought about [related problem]?"

**Goal:** Plant upsell seed, gauge interest.

### Week 4 Check-In
"It's been a month — how's [project] performing? Any new automation needs?"

**Goal:** Identify new opportunities, ask for referrals.

### Referral Request
**Only if client is thrilled:**
"You've been great to work with. Do you know anyone else who might need help with [type of work]? Happy to offer them a discount if you refer them."

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Scope Creep
**Problem:** Client keeps adding features mid-project.
**Solution:** Hard spec, explicit "NOT included" section, change requests = new quote.

### ❌ Under-Pricing
**Problem:** "Quick project" turns into 20 hours, but you quoted $1K.
**Solution:** Pad estimates (3-5 days means you have 40 hours to work with), stick to scope.

### ❌ Over-Committing
**Problem:** 5 active projects, all due "ASAP."
**Solution:** Never take more than 2-3 projects at once, realistic timelines, buffer days.

### ❌ Poor Communication
**Problem:** Client doesn't hear from you for 3 days.
**Solution:** Daily or every-other-day updates, even if "no news, just checking in."

### ❌ No Handoff
**Problem:** Deliver code, say "good luck," client can't use it.
**Solution:** 30-min handoff session, comprehensive documentation, follow-up next week.

## Metrics to Track

### Client Satisfaction
- **On-time delivery rate:** Target 95%+
- **Client happiness score:** Ask "1-10, how happy are you?" Target 9+
- **Testimonials collected:** % of happy clients who provided testimonial

### Financial
- **Revenue per project:** Track by service level
- **Margin per project:** (Revenue - Time × hourly rate)
- **Upsell rate:** % of clients who buy additional services

### Operations
- **Projects completed per month:** Track velocity
- **Average project duration:** Identify bottlenecks
- **Referral rate:** % of new clients from referrals

---

## Scaling Strategy

### Phase 1: Solo (0-3 months)
- You do everything (sales, delivery, support)
- 2-3 projects/month max
- Revenue: $5K-$10K/month

### Phase 2: Plus One (3-6 months)
- Hire contractor for execution (you handle sales + QA)
- 5-8 projects/month
- Revenue: $15K-$25K/month
- Margin: 60-70% (contractor takes 30-40%)

### Phase 3: Team (6-12 months)
- Hire project manager + 2-3 contractors
- 10-15 projects/month
- Revenue: $40K-$60K/month
- Margin: 50-60% (team overhead)

### Phase 4: Agency (12+ months)
- You focus on sales + strategy
- Team delivers everything
- 20+ projects/month
- Revenue: $100K+/month
- Margin: 40-50%

## Key Insights

1. **Standardize everything**
   Templates beat improvisation. Every project follows the same workflow.

2. **Document as you go**
   Don't "document later." Write the handoff doc during execution.

3. **Under-promise, over-deliver**
   Say 5 days, deliver in 4. Say $2K, deliver $2.5K value.

4. **Communication is oxygen**
   Silent projects = anxious clients. Update often, even with no news.

5. **Quality creates referrals**
   Happy clients tell 2-3 people. That's your best marketing.

6. **Scope creep is margin death**
   Hard spec, explicit boundaries, change requests = new quote.

7. **Track everything**
   You can't improve what you don't measure. Revenue, satisfaction, margin, velocity.

8. **Plan for scale from day one**
   Build systems, not just solutions. Systems scale; you don't.

---

**Core principle:** Service businesses win on execution, not sales. Great operations → happy clients → referrals → repeat business → scalable agency.

**Math:** 2 projects/month at $1.5K = $3K/month (solo). 10 projects/month at $2K avg = $20K/month (team). Systems make the difference.

**Implementation:** Start today. Document your current workflow. Identify gaps. Build templates. Standardize every phase.
