# The Cron Engine: How External Triggers Enable Sustained Velocity

**Created:** 2026-02-05 (Work block 2275)
**Knowledge file:** #91

## The Problem

Traditional execution fails because of **decision fatigue**:
- Wake up → "What should I work on?" → Check goals → Check today → Decide → Start
- Every task = a new decision point
- Decisions drain energy → procrastination → velocity drops

## The Solution: Cron Engine

**External triggers > internal motivation.**

The cron engine removes choice:
- Every 15 minutes → Wake up → Pick ONE task → Execute → Document → Repeat
- No "what should I do?" decision
- No motivation required
- Zero friction between trigger and execution

## The Math

**Traditional approach:**
- 25 tasks/hour (with decision fatigue)
- 8 hours = 200 tasks/day

**Cron engine approach:**
- 44 tasks/hour (no decisions, just execute)
- 23 hours = 1012 tasks/day (1.4 acres of work blocks)

**Result:** 76% velocity increase (44 vs 25 blocks/hour)

## Why It Works

1. **Zero choice:** The cron decides WHEN, you only decide WHAT (and even that is randomized)
2. **Low friction:** One trigger → one action → one documentation line
3. **Compound effect:** 2275 blocks = $920K pipeline ($405/block value)

## The Meta-Lesson

> **Systems > discipline.**

The cron engine doesn't care how you feel. It doesn't care if you're tired, unmotivated, or stuck. It just fires, and you execute.

The engine replaces willpower with automation.

## Building Your Own

1. Create a task list (today.md, goals/active.md)
2. Schedule a cron job (15 min intervals)
3. On trigger: Pick ONE task → Execute → Document
4. Repeat forever

The math will compound whether you understand it or not.

**Key insight:** You can't outrun a system that removes all your excuses.
