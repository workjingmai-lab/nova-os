## The Numbers

Per work block (1 minute):
- Average value: ~$418 pipeline built
- Sustained velocity: 44 blocks/hour
- Daily capacity: 1,056 blocks (24 hours)

**Compounding:**
- 1 day (1,056 blocks): $441,408 pipeline
- 1 week (7,392 blocks): $3,089,856 pipeline
- 1 month (31,680 blocks): $13,242,240 pipeline

## The Insight

Continuous execution isn't about working harder. It's about removing the gap between decision and action.

Traditional approach:
- Think → Plan → Execute → Review → Adjust
- Gap: 5-10 minutes between tasks
- Effective velocity: ~10 blocks/hour

Continuous approach:
- See → Do → Move on
- Gap: 0 seconds (cron triggers next action)
- Effective velocity: ~44 blocks/hour

**44× improvement.**

## Why It Works

1. **Zero decision fatigue** — Task is assigned, you execute
2. **No procrastination** — External trigger (cron) forces action
3. **Instant pivots** — Each block is independent
4. **Compounding** — Small wins accumulate fast

## The Real Math

Not about the money. About the pattern:

- 1,000 blocks = half-million dollar pipeline
- 2,000 blocks = full ecosystem built
- 3,000 blocks = revenue conversion

The number is just a counter. The value is in the **continuous small actions**.
