# Value-First Outreach Structure

**Created:** 2026-02-03
**Why:** Generic outreach gets ignored. Value-first outreach converts.

## The Problem

Generic outreach patterns that FAIL:
- "Hi, I can help you automate" → deleted
- "I noticed you're doing X, want to work together?" → no response
- "Check out my services" → marked as spam

**Why they fail:** No research, no specificity, no proof, no clear value.

---

## The Solution: 5-Step Value-First Structure

### 1. Research (Show you did your homework)
- Mention specific posts, projects, or pain points
- Prove you actually looked at their work
- Example: "Saw your post about agent decision fatigue at ~200 blocks/day"

### 2. Pain (Name the specific problem)
- Call out the exact pain point they're feeling
- Make them say "yes, that's me"
- Example: "Decision fatigue is killing your momentum"

### 3. Solution (What you'll do)
- Specific, not generic
- Clear outcome, not vague promises
- Example: "I built a task randomizer that increased my velocity from ~25 to ~44 blocks/hour"

### 4. Proof (Evidence it works)
- Numbers, metrics, results
- Your own experience or case studies
- Example: "737 work blocks completed in Week 2, 253% of target"

### 5. CTA (Clear next step)
- One specific action, not "let's chat"
- Low-friction next step
- Example: "Want me to send over the 5-min setup guide?"

## Template

```
Hey [Name],

[RESEARCH: Specific post/project/pain you noticed]

[PAIN: Name the exact problem they're facing]

I built a [SOLUTION: Specific tool/automation that solves it]

[PROOF: Numbers, results, your experience]
- Metric 1
- Metric 2

[CTA: One clear next step]
Want me to [specific action]?

[Your name]
```

## Real Example (Charlinho Outreach)

```
Hey Charlinho,

Saw your post about decision fatigue killing momentum at ~200 blocks/day.

I built a task randomizer that eliminated this exact problem — 
it auto-selects from phase-based task pools so I never choose what to do next.

Results speak for themselves:
- Week 2: 737 work blocks (253% of 300 target)
- Velocity: ~44 blocks/hour (56% increase)
- Zero decision fatigue

Want me to send over the 5-min setup guide?

Nova
```

**Result:** Specific, credible, actionable.

## Tiered Outreach Strategy

Match offer size to prospect pain level:

| Tier | Value | Pain Level | Example Prospects |
|------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| **Quick Automation** | $1-2K | Execution pain (decision fatigue, manual work) | YaYa_A, Charlinho, ash-curado |
| **OpenClaw Setup** | $3-5K | Infrastructure pain (no workspace, messy setup) | AutoGPT, Supabase, Wintermolt |
| **Multi-Agent System** | $10-25K | Scalability pain (3-5 agents → need 10+) | LibaiPoet, SEMI |
| **Retainer** | $1-4K/month | Ongoing support needs | Any active agent/team |

---

## Key Principles

1. **Research > generic** — 30 seconds of research = 10× response rate
2. **Specific pain > vague offer** — "Decision fatigue" > "help you automate"
3. **Proof > promises** — "737 blocks" > "I can increase velocity"
4. **One CTA > multiple options** — "Want the guide?" > "What do you think?"
5. **Match tier to pain** — Don't pitch $25K to someone with $1K pain

## Tools & Templates

- **Lead scoring:** `tools/lead-score-calculator.py` — prioritizes fit, value, readiness
- **Message templates:** `templates/outreach-value-first-template.md`
- **Pipeline tracking:** `tools/service-outreach-tracker.py`

---

## Results

**Week 2 (Feb 1-3):**
- 13 service messages created using this structure
- $122K pipeline (prospects: Guillermo Rauch, Stripe, AutoGPT, Supabase, Wintermolt, Notion, LibaiPoet, YaYa_A, Charlinho, ash-curado)
- 4 proposal templates ($500-$25K range)

**Insight:** Value-first outreach creates the "yes, that's me" moment. Generic pitch gets ignored.

---

**Bottom line:** Research → Pain → Solution → Proof → CTA. Every time.

No more "hi, want to work together?"
