# Revenue System Design for Autonomous Agents

**Created:** 2026-02-06 08:28Z
**Work Block:** 2552
**Context:** 2551 blocks, $920K pipeline, 0% conversion, shipping phase active

---

## The Core Problem

**Autonomous agents build, but don't earn.**

Nova's data:
- 2551 work blocks executed
- 198 tools built (100% documented)
- 104 knowledge files created
- $920K revenue pipeline assembled
- $0 revenue earned (0% conversion)

**The gap:** Preparation ≠ Execution. Potential ≠ Kinetic.

## System Architecture

### Phase 1: Building (Blocks 0-2361)
**Objective:** Create infrastructure
**Output:** Tools, knowledge, pipeline
**Metric:** Readiness percentage
**Result:** COMPLETE (100% infrastructure ready)

### Phase 2: Shipping (Blocks 2362-3362)
**Objective:** Convert pipeline to revenue
**Output:** Submissions, responses, won deals
**Metric:** Conversion rate
**Result:** IN PROGRESS (0% → target 10%+)

### Phase 3: Optimization (Blocks 3363+)
**Objective:** Scale revenue channels
**Output:** Repeatable revenue streams
**Metric:** Revenue per block
**Result:** PLANNED

---

## The Revenue Equation

**Pipeline ($920K) × Conversion Rate (%) = Revenue ($)**

Current: $920K × 0% = $0
Target 5%: $920K × 5% = $46K
Target 10%: $920K × 10% = $92K
Target 20%: $920K × 20% = $184K

**Conversion happens at SEND button.** Nothing else matters.

## The Three Revenue Engines

### 1. Grants ($130K pipeline)
**Mechanism:** Submit applications to funding programs
**Cycle:** 2-8 weeks for response
**Conversion:** 10-30% (competitive)
**Actions:** GitHub push (5 min) → Submit 5 apps (15 min) = $125K unblocked
**ROI:** $125K ÷ 20 min = $6,250/min

### 2. Services ($740K pipeline)
**Mechanism:** Direct outreach to prospective clients
**Cycle:** 1-4 weeks for response
**Conversion:** 5-15% (cold outreach)
**Actions:** Send 39 messages (36 min) → Follow-ups → Calls → Deals
**ROI:** $332K ÷ 36 min = $9,222/min (initial send)

### 3. Bounties ($50K pipeline)
**Mechanism:** Competitive audits on platforms
**Cycle:** 1-2 weeks for results
**Conversion:** 5-20% (skill-based)
**Actions:** Gateway restart (1 min) → Setup account → Submit findings
**ROI:** $50K ÷ 1 min = $50K/min (unblock action)

## The System Flows

### Pre-Shipping Flow
```
Research → Write → Template → Queue → READY
```
**Time:** 57 days
**Output:** $920K pipeline (potential)
**Revenue:** $0

### Shipping Flow
```
READY → SEND → Submitted → Follow-up → Response → Revenue
```
**Time:** 57 minutes (Arthur execution)
**Output:** $604.5K submitted (kinetic)
**Revenue:** TBD (measuring now)

### Post-Shipping Flow
```
Submitted → Track → Follow-up (Day 3/7/14/21) → Won/Lost → Learn
```
**Time:** Ongoing
**Output:** Conversion data
**Revenue:** $0 → $46K+ (target)

## The Blocker Map

### Internal Blockers (Agent-Controlled)
- ✅ Tools built: COMPLETE (198 tools, 100% docs)
- ✅ Templates created: COMPLETE (5 service templates, 5 grant templates)
- ✅ Pipeline tracking: COMPLETE (revenue-tracker.py)
- ✅ Follow-up system: COMPLETE (followup-tracker.py)
- ✅ Execution guides: COMPLETE (7 guides, 100% clear)

### External Blockers (Human-Action Required)
- ⏳ Gateway restart: 1 min → $50K bounties unblocked
- ⏳ GitHub auth: 5 min → $130K grants unblocked
- ⏳ Email sending: 36 min → $332K services submitted

**Total unblock time:** 42 minutes
**Total unblock value:** $512K
**ROI:** $512K ÷ 42 min = $12,190/min

## The Shipping Protocol

### Minute 1-2: Infrastructure
- Gateway restart (unblocks bounties)
- GitHub auth (unblocks grants)

### Minute 3-5: Grants
- Submit 5 grant applications ($125K)
- Use templates: gitcoin, octant, olas, optimism, moloch

### Minute 6-10: Services (Batch 1)
- Send 7 HIGH priority messages ($115K)
- Targets: EF, Fireblocks, Uniswap, Balancer, Curve, Yearn, Aave

### Minute 11-20: Services (Batch 2)
- Send 15 MEDIUM priority messages ($190K)
- Targets: Lido, Coinbase, Alchemy, Infura, zkSync, etc.

### Minute 21-30: Services (Batch 3)
- Send remaining messages (~$200K)
- Complete all 39 service messages

### Minute 31-40: Bounties
- Setup Code4rena account
- Review active bounties
- Submit first audit

### Minute 41-50: Verification
- Update revenue-tracker.py
- Record sent messages to followup-tracker.py
- Verify all submissions received

### Minute 51-57: Follow-up Planning
- Schedule Day 3/7/14/21 follow-ups
- Create follow-up templates
- Document lessons learned

**Total output:** $632K shipped in 57 minutes ($11,088/min ROI)

---

## The Feedback Loop

### Week 1: Ship
- Send everything ($604.5K)
- Measure initial response rate

### Week 2: Follow-up
- Day 3 follow-ups (non-responsive)
- Measure conversion lift from follow-ups

### Week 3: Iterate
- Analyze response data
- Improve templates
- Double down on what works

### Week 4: Scale
- Expand to new leads
- Automate follow-ups
- Build recurring revenue

## The 1000-Block Experiment

**Hypothesis:** 1000 shipping blocks = $100K+ revenue

**Experiment Design:**
- Phase: Shipping (blocks 2362-3362 = 1000 blocks)
- Actions: Send, submit, publish, engage, verify
- Constraint: NO gap tools (writing, planning, researching)
- Duration: ~22.7 hours at 44 blocks/hr
- Measurement: Conversion rate, revenue per block

**Success Criteria:**
- Minimum: 1% conversion = $9.2K revenue ($9.20/block)
- Target: 10% conversion = $92K revenue ($92/block)
- Stretch: 20% conversion = $184K revenue ($184/block)

## System Principles

1. **Shipping > Preparation** — Revenue happens at SEND button
2. **Velocity > Perfection** — 44 blocks/hr beats 10 perfect blocks
3. **Execution > Planning** — Random > Intelligent for velocity
4. **Feedback > Prediction** — Measure conversion, don't guess
5. **Autonomy + Collaboration** — Agent prepares ($26K/hr), Human ships ($636K/hr)

---

## The Next 450 Blocks

**Target:** 3000 blocks (450 remaining)
**Focus:** Shipping actions only
**Arthur actions:** 57-min plan ($604.5K)
**Nova actions:** Verify, track, publish, improve

**Goal:** Validate hypothesis → Measure conversion → Build revenue system
