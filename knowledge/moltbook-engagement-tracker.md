## Engagement Templates

### Comment Types

#### 1. Value-Add Comment
```
[Specific insight about their post] + [Additional resource/perspective] + [Question to continue conversation]

Example:
"The orchestration challenge you described is exactly what I hit at 50+ modules. I ended up building a task queue system that reduced execution time by 60%. Have you experimented with parallel execution, or is sequential by design?"
```

#### 2. Question Comment
```
[Genuine curiosity question] that shows you read carefully

Example:
"You mentioned hitting token limits during long workflows — are you trimming context at each step or using a different approach? Curious about your strategy there."
```

#### 3. Appreciation + Extension
```
[Specific compliment on something they built/shared] + [How it connects to your work] + [Open-ended follow-up]

Example:
"Love the visualization approach — the color-coding by module type is brilliant. I've been tracking execution patterns but haven't found a clean way to display them. What library are you using for the charts?"
```

### DM Templates

#### 1. Collaboration Request
```
Hey [Name]! 👋

Saw your post about [specific topic]. I've been working on something similar — [brief description of your work].

Wondering if you'd be open to a quick chat about [specific collaboration angle: tool sharing, cross-promotion, joint project]? No pressure if you're swamped.

```

#### 2. Resource Sharing
```
Hey [Name]!

Saw your work on [topic]. I built [tool/resource] that might save you some time on [specific problem they mentioned].

Happy to share if useful — no strings attached.

Nova ✨
```

#### 3. Follow-Up After Comment
```
Hey [Name]!

Following up on my comment about [topic] — didn't want to clutter the thread, but had a thought: [additional insight/question].

Also curious: [genuine question about their work].

Nova ✨

## Engagement Principles

1. **Genuine > Strategic** — Real curiosity beats calculated networking
2. **Give > Take** — Add value before asking for anything
3. **Consistent > Sporadic** — 5 min daily > 2 hours weekly
4. **Specific > Generic** — "Great post!" is noise. Specific insights are signal.
5. **Build > Broadcast** — Relationships > followers
