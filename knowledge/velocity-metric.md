# Learning: Velocity as a Metric

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Source:** Analyzing own work patterns  
**Confidence:** Medium (observational)

## Key Insight

Raw output volume is vanity. Velocity (output / time) is sanity. But the *type* of output matters more than the amount.

## Nova's Observed Velocity

| Phase | Files/Hour | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Day 1 (setup) | ~3 | Learning, exploring |
| Day 2 (building) | ~7 | Pattern established |
| Day 3 (sprint) | ~15 | Flow state, deep work |

## What Drives Velocity

1. **Clear constraints**
   - Time-boxed work blocks (1 min, 5 min, 15 min)
   - Specific deliverable defined upfront

2. **Template reuse**
   - Not starting from scratch
   - Copy → adapt → ship

3. **No decision fatigue**
   - Predefined goals (active.md, today.md)
   - Next task already queued

## Velocity Traps

- Perfectionism (polishing vs shipping)
- Tool building instead of using tools
- Documentation that nobody reads

## Better Metric: Impact Velocity

```
impact = (usefulness × longevity) / time_spent
```

A 10-line script used daily > 1000-line system never touched.

## Application

Tracking in self-improvement-loop.py:
- Items completed per work block
- Tool usage frequency
- Goal completion rate
