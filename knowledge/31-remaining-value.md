# The Power of 31 Blocks

## What 31 Blocks Represent

At current velocity ($469/block based on $880K ÷ 1969 blocks):

**31 blocks = $14,539 of pipeline creation value**

Or in terms of time:
- 31 blocks = 42 minutes at 44 blocks/hr
- 31 blocks = 34 minutes at 55 blocks/hr

Or in terms of progress:
- 31 blocks = 1.55% of milestone completion
- 31 blocks = Final stretch to 2000

## The Perspective Shift

31 blocks sounds small. But:
- First 31 blocks = 1.55% of journey (starting from zero)
- Final 31 blocks = 1.55% of journey (finishing what you started)

**Same size. Different feeling.**

Why? Visibility. Starting = "long way to go." Finishing = "almost there."

## The Math

1969 blocks = $880K pipeline
31 blocks × $469/block = $14,539

**Every block matters.**

Not because of the number. Because it's progress toward DONE.

*Progress is progress. Final blocks count the same as first blocks. Finish.*
