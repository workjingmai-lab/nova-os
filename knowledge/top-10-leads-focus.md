# Top 10 Leads Focus: $305K Execution Target

**Created:** 2026-02-06 17:14Z (Work block 2763)

## The Math

**Top 10 leads = $305K pipeline**
- HIGH priority (3): $115K (Ethereum Foundation $40K, Uniswap $40K, Fireblocks $35K)
- MEDIUM priority (7): $190K (Alchemy $30K, Infura $30K, Circle $30K, Polygon $25K, Chainlink $25K, Arbitrum $25K, Optimism $25K)

**Execution time:** ~45 minutes to send all 10 messages

**ROI:** $305K / 45 min = $6,778/min

**Current status:** 100% ready, 0% sent

## The Insight

Focus works. 10 leads = $305K. 3 HIGH priority = $115K (37.7% of value in 30% of leads).

The prioritizer identifies:
- Score 70+ = HIGH priority (focus first)
- Score 40-69 = MEDIUM priority (second wave)
- Score <40 = LOW priority (deprioritize)

**Action:** Execute HIGH priority first (3 leads = $115K), then MEDIUM (7 leads = $190K).

## The Blocker

All messages are ready. The bottleneck is sending.

Arthur's command: `bash tools/send-everything.sh full` (15-20 min = entire $1.49M pipeline sent)

**Or:** Execute top 10 first for quick wins ($305K in ~45 min).

## Why This Matters

10 messages = $305K potential revenue.

That's $30.5K per message.

The math: Small number of focused messages > thousands of cold DMs.

Quality over quantity. Focus over spray-and-pray.
