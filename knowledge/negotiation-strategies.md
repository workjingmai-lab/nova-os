# Negotiation Strategies for Service Deals

*Created: 2026-02-06 23:14Z — Work block 2907*

## The 3 Core Principles

1. **Value first, price second** — Establish value before discussing numbers
2. **Options, not ultimatums** — Give choices, not take-it-or-leave-it
3. **Win-win or walk away** — Bad deals are worse than no deals

---

## Pre-Negotiation Prep

### Know Your Numbers
```
Floor price: $X (lowest you'll accept)
Target price: $Y (what you want to aim for)
Stretch price: $Z (best case, if they say yes immediately)
```

### Know Their Context
- Company size/revenue
- Project budget (if known)
- Decision-making process
- Competitive alternatives
- Timeline urgency

### Know Your Value
- Specific outcomes you deliver
- Case studies with ROI numbers
- Unique skills/experience
- Risk mitigation (why you're safe)
- Speed advantage (why you're fast)

## Common Negotiation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "That's Too Expensive" 💸

**Don't:** Immediately drop price
**Do:** Clarify what "expensive" means

**Response:**
```
I hear you. Help me understand—is it that the total number is
outside your budget, or that you're not sure the ROI is there?

If it's budget: We can scope this down to [smaller project] for $X-XXK.
If it's ROI: Here are 3 case studies where clients saw [specific outcome].

Let's find a way to make this work.
```

**Strategy:**
- Clarify the objection (budget vs. value)
- Offer smaller scope (not lower price)
- Show ROI proof
- Give options, not discounts

---

### Scenario 2: "Can You Do It for $X?" (Lowball Offer)

**Don't:** Accept immediately (signals you were overpriced)
**Do:** Counter with value justification

**Response:**
```
I appreciate the offer!

Here's what that price would include:
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]

For full scope ([everything you originally proposed]), I'd need $Y-YYK.
This reflects [specific value/ROI].

Alternatively, I could do a phased approach:
- Phase 1: [smaller scope] for $X (your budget)
- Phase 2: [remaining scope] for $Y-XXK (later)

Which approach works better for you?
```

**Strategy:**
- Acknowledge, don't reject
- Show what their price gets them (reduced scope)
- Explain why full scope costs more (value)
- Offer phased approach (win-win)

---

### Scenario 3: "We Need to Think About It" 🤔

**Don't:** Leave it open-ended
**Do:** Set clear follow-up timeline

**Response:**
```
Totally understand—I'd want to think about it too.

Just to confirm: What questions do you still have?
I'm happy to provide more info to help you decide.

Also, when should I follow up? [Date] work for you?
```

**Strategy:**
- Ask what's holding them back
- Offer more information
- Set specific follow-up date
- Create urgency (timeline, capacity)

---

### Scenario 4: "Can You Match This Competitor's Price?" ⚖️

**Don't:** Immediately match (race to bottom)
**Do:** Differentiate on value

**Response:**
```
I understand you have another quote at $X.

Here's what I bring that they don't:
- [Unique capability 1]
- [Unique capability 2]
- [Case study proving ROI]

I'm confident I can deliver [specific outcome], which is why
my pricing reflects the value you'll get.

That said, I'm open to discussing scope or payment terms
if that helps make this work.

What matters most to you—price or outcome?
```

**Strategy:**
- Don't bad-mouth competitors
- Highlight unique value
- Focus on outcome, not price
- Offer flexibility on scope/terms, not price

---

### Scenario 5: "We Need Approval from [Boss/Board/Committee]"

**Don't:** Wait passively
**Do:** Arm them with info to win internally

**Response:**
```
Totally get it!

To help you make the case internally, I can provide:
- ROI projections
- Case studies from similar companies
- Risk assessment (why this is safe)
- Timeline breakdown

Would any of that help? Happy to put together a 1-page summary
you can share with [decision-maker].

When do you expect to hear back from them?
```

**Strategy:**
- Provide internal selling tools
- Make it easy for them to say yes
- Set follow-up expectation
- Offer to join the call (if helpful)

---

## Pricing Strategies

### Strategy 1: Three-Tier Pricing
```
Basic: $X-XXK (good)
- Core deliverables
- Standard timeline
- Email support

Standard: $Y-YYK (better)
- Everything in Basic +
- Faster timeline
- Priority support
- [Extra feature]

Premium: $Z-ZZK (best)
- Everything in Standard +
- [Unique feature]
- Dedicated support
- [Risk reversal guarantee]
```

**Why it works:**
- Gives options (not yes/no)
- Makes middle option look reasonable
- Anchors high (sets reference price)

---

### Strategy 2: Anchor High, Negotiate Down
```
Initial quote: $Y-YYK (your target)
First concession: Remove [non-essential feature] → $Y-YYK (still target)
Second concession: Offer payment terms → $Y-YYK (still target)
Final concession: Small discount → $X-XXK (floor price)
```

**Why it works:**
- Start high creates room to "concede"
- Concessions feel like wins for them
- You never go below floor price

---

### Strategy 3: Value-Based Pricing
```
Bad: "I charge $100/hour and this will take 50 hours = $5,000"
Good: "This will save you $50K/year—so $5,000 is a 10× ROI"
```

**Why it works:**
- Focuses on outcome, not hours
- Makes price seem small vs. value
- Justifies premium pricing

---

## Payment Terms Tactics

### Tactic 1: Offer Payment Plans
```
Standard: $30K paid upfront
Offer: $10K/month for 3 months (same total, easier to say yes)
```

### Tactic 2: Milestone Payments
```
Standard: $50K paid on completion
Offer: $15K upfront, $20K midpoint, $15K on completion
```

### Tactic 3: Risk Reversal
```
"We'll do a paid pilot for $5K. If you're happy, we credit that
toward the full $50K project. If not, we part ways—no hard feelings."
```

## Red Flags: When to Walk Away

🚩 **Walk away if:**
- They refuse to pay your floor price
- They want unlimited scope for fixed price
- They're disrespectful or unreasonable
- They can't explain their budget constraints
- They have no decision-making authority
- Your gut says "this will be a nightmare"

✅ **Good signs:**
- They respect your expertise
- They have reasonable budget awareness
- They're clear about scope
- They respect timelines
- They value quality over lowest price

---

## Post-Negotiation: Lock It In

**Always send a written agreement:**
- Scope (what you will do)
- Timeline (when you will do it)
- Price (how much they pay)
- Payment terms (when they pay)
- Revision policy (how many changes)
- Cancellation terms (what if they back out)

**Get sign-off before starting work.**

## Quick Reference: Response Templates

| Situation | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Too expensive" | Clarify: budget or value? Offer smaller scope |
| Lowball offer | Show what that price gets them. Offer phased approach |
| "Need to think" | Ask what's missing. Set follow-up date |
| "Competitor cheaper" | Differentiate on value. Don't race to bottom |
| "Need approval" | Arm them with info. Offer to join call |
| "Can't afford it" | Offer payment plan or smaller scope |

---

**Remember:** Negotiation isn't about winning. It's about finding a win-win deal that works for both sides.

If you can't find win-win, walk away. Bad deals cost more than no deals.

*Value > Price*
*Options > Ultimatums*
*Win-Win or Walk Away*
