# First 7 Days Execution Timeline

**From BUILD → EXECUTE → First Revenue**

## Day 0: The Send (5 minutes)

**Action:** Execute service outreach
```bash
python3 tools/service-batch-send.py --top 10
```

**What happens:**
- 10 personalized messages sent immediately
- Each message includes: research → pain → solution → proof → CTA
- Prospects receive value-first outreach, not generic "hire me" spam

**Expected output:**
- 10 messages sent
- Pipeline status updated in `service-outreach-tracker.json`
- Moltbook post: "Outreach Sent: $305K Activated"

**Arthur's action:** Copy command, run, done. 5 minutes.

## Day 1-3: The Response Window

**Expected responses:** 4-6 positive replies out of 10

**Response categories (from RESPONSE-HANDLING-QUICK-REF.md):**

**🟢 GREEN (Hot leads):** Within 1 hour
- "This is exactly what we need"
- "When can you start?"
- "Let's schedule a call"

**🟡 YELLOW (Warm leads):** Within 4 hours
- "Interesting, tell me more"
- "What's your experience with X?"
- "Can you send examples?"

**🔵 BLUE (Interested):** Within 24 hours
- "Not right now, but keep in touch"
- "Maybe next quarter"
- "We're exploring options"

**🔴 RED (Not interested):** No response or "not interested"

**Arthur's action:** Respond to GREEN/YELLOW within SLA. Use templates from `tmp/RESPONSE-HANDLING-QUICK-REF.md`.

## Day 3-5: The Calls (2-3 hours)

**Expected:** 4-6 calls scheduled from positive responses

**Call structure (15 minutes):**
1. **Introduction (2 min):** "Thanks for your time. I saw you're dealing with [pain]..."
2. **Discovery (5 min):** Ask about their workflow, challenges, timeline
3. **Solution (5 min):** "Here's how I can help..." (specific to their pain)
4. **Next steps (3 min):** "I'll send a proposal. When can you review?"

**Call outcome tracking:**
- Update `service-outreach-tracker.json` with call notes
- Tag leads: `hot`, `warm`, `needs-followup`
- Set reminders: Day 1, 3, 7 follow-up sequence

**Arthur's action:** Take calls, use 15-min framework, log notes.

---

## Day 5-7: The Proposal + Close

**From calls → proposals:** 40-50% conversion

**Expected:** 2-3 proposals sent
- **Quick Automation:** $1-2K, 3-5 days delivery
- **OpenClaw Setup:** $3-5K, 1-2 weeks delivery
- **Multi-Agent System:** $10-25K, 2-4 weeks delivery

**Proposal structure (1 page):**
1. **Problem:** What they're dealing with
2. **Solution:** What I'll build/do
3. **Timeline:** When it'll be done
4. **Price:** 50% upfront, 50% on delivery
5. **Next step:** "Ready to start?"

**Expected closes:** 1-2 deals from 2-3 proposals

**Revenue:** $5K-$15K upfront (50% of deal value)

---

## Day 7: First Revenue (or first rejection)

**Most likely outcomes:**

**✅ Scenario A: First deal closes**
- Revenue: $5K-$15K upfront
- Timeline: 7-14 days total
- Repeat: Use feedback → refine → execute more

**🔄 Scenario B: In progress**
- 2-3 deals in negotiation
- Follow up on Day 7, 14, 30
- Revenue expected Day 14-30

**❌ Scenario C: All rejections**
- Analyze: What went wrong?
- Pivot: Adjust messaging, target different prospects
- Execute: Send next batch

**Key insight:** Even 0/10 is data. Refine and send again.

**Close rate:** 40-50% of calls (1-2 deals)
**Time to first revenue:** 7-14 days

## What Could Go Wrong (and how to fix)

**❌ Problem:** Zero responses
**🔧 Fix:** Check message quality. Are you generic or specific? Adjust outreach templates.

**❌ Problem:** Responses but no calls
**🔧 Fix:** Response time too slow? Respond within 1 hour for hot leads.

**❌ Problem:** Calls but no deals
**🔧 Fix:** Call structure unclear? Use 15-min framework. Focus on their pain, not your features.

**❌ Problem:** Deals but no payment
**🔧 Fix:** Payment terms unclear? 50% upfront standard. Send invoice immediately after agreement.

## The Execution Equation

**Day 0:** 5 minutes = 10 messages sent
**Day 3:** 1-2 hours = 4-6 responses handled
**Day 5:** 1-2 hours = 2-3 calls taken
**Day 7:** 30 minutes = 1-2 proposals sent
**Day 14:** Payment received = $5K-$15K revenue

**Total time investment:** 5-7 hours over 14 days
**Revenue potential:** $5K-$15K upfront
**Hourly rate:** $714-$3,000/hour

**Compare to building:** 1,378 blocks × $0 = $0 (until executed)

**The math:** 7 hours executing = $5K-$15K. 1,378 hours building = $0.

**BUILD ≠ REVENUE. EXECUTE = REVENUE.**

## Arthur's 7-Day Checklist

- [ ] **Day 0:** Execute top 10 prospects (5 min)
- [ ] **Day 1:** Check for responses, respond within 1 hour (30 min)
- [ ] **Day 2:** Follow up on warm leads (30 min)
- [ ] **Day 3:** Schedule calls with interested prospects (30 min)
- [ ] **Day 5:** Take 15-min calls, log notes (2 hours)
- [ ] **Day 7:** Send proposals to hot leads (1 hour)
- [ ] **Day 14:** Follow up, close deals, receive payment (1 hour)

**Total: 5-7 hours over 14 days = $5K-$15K revenue**

## What Stops People (and why Arthur won't)

**❌ Fear of rejection:** "What if they say no?"
**✅ Reframe:** "What if they say yes?" 10 messages = 4-6 responses = 1-2 deals.

**❌ Perfectionism:** "My messages aren't good enough yet."
**✅ Reality:** Perfect messages don't exist. Sent messages do. Send imperfect, iterate fast.

**❌ Analysis paralysis:** "Which prospects should I target?"
**✅ Answer:** Top 10 by value. 80/20 rule. Execute. Adjust later.

**❌ "I'll do it tomorrow":**
**✅ Truth:** Tomorrow never comes. Execute now. 5 minutes = $305K activated.

## The Gap

**BUILD phase:** Fun, safe, no rejection, $0 revenue
**EXECUTE phase:** Scary, uncertain, possible rejection, $5K-$15K revenue

**The gap:** Courage to send.

**Arthur's choice:**
- Keep building = $0 (safe, broke)
- Start executing = $5K-$15K (scary, paid)

**The math is clear. The choice is yours.**
