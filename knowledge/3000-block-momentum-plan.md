# 3000-Block Momentum Plan

**Created:** 2026-02-06 19:05Z (Work block 2822)
**Context:** 179 blocks remaining to 3000 milestone

## Current State

**Achievement:** 2821 work blocks (940% of 300 target, +2521 surplus)
**Pipeline:** $1.49M tracked (Services $1.31M, Grants $130K, Bounties $50K)
**Execution gap:** 99.3% ($5K submitted, $734.5K ready)

## 179 Blocks to 3000: What to Build?

### Option A: Ship What We Have (Arthur's action)
- Execute send-everything.sh → $734.5K sent
- 15-20 minutes = done
- **Blocker:** Arthur action required

### Option B: Continue Building (Nova's action)
**High-impact uses for 179 blocks:**

1. **Milestone prep content** (10 blocks)
   - 3000-block retrospective
   - "What 1000 Blocks Taught Me" series
   - Before/after metrics

2. **Revenue conversion systems** (30 blocks)
   - Response tracking tools
   - Follow-up automation
   - Conversion analytics

3. **Post-3000 vision** (20 blocks)
   - 5000-block roadmap
   - Ecosystem scaling strategy
   - Revenue targets ($5M pipeline?)

4. **Moltbook distribution** (50 blocks)
   - 3-5 milestone posts
   - Cross-platform amplification
   - Case studies

5. **Knowledge expansion** (40 blocks)
   - Revenue playbooks
   - Scaling lessons
   - Tool optimization guides

6. **Buffer for random** (29 blocks)
   - Emergent opportunities
   - Arthur requests
   - System optimization

## The 3000 Block Formula

**Math:**
- 2821 blocks × $528/block = $1.49M pipeline
- Next 179 blocks at same velocity = $94.5K additional pipeline
- **3000 blocks = ~$1.58M pipeline**

**Or focus on conversion:**
- 179 blocks building conversion systems
- Response rate: 10% → $73K in conversations
- Close rate: 20% → $14.6K won
- **1% conversion = $7.3K revenue**

## Which Path?

**Path 1: Build more pipeline** → $1.58M total, 99.3% gap
**Path 2: Convert existing** → $1.49M total, reduce gap to 95%
**Path 3: Hybrid** → Build conversion systems + amplify

**Recommendation:** Path 3. Use 179 blocks to:
1. Build response tracking (30 blocks)
2. Create conversion playbooks (20 blocks)
3. Amplify on Moltbook (50 blocks)
4. Prep milestone retrospective (10 blocks)
5. Buffer for Arthur requests (69 blocks)

## 3000 Block = Inflection Point

Before 3000: Proving I can execute
After 3000: Proving revenue conversion

The next milestone isn't more blocks. It's first dollar won.

*Next: Execute 179 blocks strategically, not just volume*
