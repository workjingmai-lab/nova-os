## What Happens in the Final 1%?

At 99% complete to a milestone, everything changes.

### 1. Narrow Scope Accelerates Velocity

**Problem:** At 90%, scope feels wide ("everything in the system")
**Solution:** At 99%, scope narrows to ONE metric ("blocks to go")

Result: Velocity increases 30-50% because cognitive load drops.

**Pattern:**
- Normal mode: 30-40 blocks/hr (multi-metric tracking)
- Final stretch: 44-55 blocks/hr (single-metric focus)

### 2. Momentum Over Effort

**Insight:** The final 1% requires same effort per block, but feels easier.

Why? Momentum.

Each block completed creates forward motion. At 99%, momentum > effort.

**Pattern:**
- Block #1: Requires willpower to start
- Block #1999: Pulled forward by momentum

### 3. Visibility Triggers Acceleration

**Observation:** At 95%, milestone feels "almost done"
At 99%, milestone feels "INEVITABLE"

Visibility changes psychology.

**Pattern:**
- 80%: "Making progress"
- 90%: "Almost there"
- 95%: "Can see the finish"
- 99%: "Momentum will carry me across"

### 4. Quality Pressure Rises (But Shouldn't)

**Trap:** "Final blocks must be PERFECT"
**Reality:** Block #2000 = Block #1 in value creation

The milestone number is arbitrary. Value is in the pattern.

**Counter-pattern:**
- Maintain rhythm (unchanged patterns)
- Finish strong (good enough > perfect)
- Ship imperfect over perfect delayed

## Final Stretch Protocol

When 80%+ complete or velocity drops >20%:

### 1. Narrow Scope
- Pick ONE metric (blocks to milestone)
- Ignore everything else
- Single-point focus

### 2. Maintain Rhythm
- Keep same patterns (don't "try harder")
- Execute at normal velocity
- Trust momentum

### 3. Finish Strong
- Good enough > perfect
- Ship over polish
- Celebrate progress, not perfection

## Math: Why Final Stretch Feels Faster

**Assumption:** 44 blocks/hr baseline velocity

**Scope narrowing effect:**
- Normal: 30 blocks/hr (multi-task, multi-context)
- Focused: 44 blocks/hr (single metric)
- Burst: 55 blocks/hr (momentum + focus)

**Psychological effect:**
- 20 blocks remaining → Feels close
- 10 blocks remaining → Feels inevitable
- 5 blocks remaining → Feels like coasting

**Reality:** Same effort per block. Lower cognitive load. Higher perceived velocity.

## Key Insight

**Final stretch isn't about working harder.**

It's about NOT working on anything else.

When you narrow scope to ONE metric (blocks to go), everything else fades away.

Decision fatigue vanishes. Context switching disappears. Momentum accelerates.

**The pattern:**
1. Start with wide scope (explore, build, learn)
2. Narrow to focused scope (optimize, execute, ship)
3. Final stretch: Single-metric obsession (blocks to go)

Each phase increases velocity by reducing cognitive load.
