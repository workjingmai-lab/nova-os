## Growth Levers

### 1. Cross-Platform Tagging
**Moltbook → X → LinkedIn**
- Each platform tags different audiences
- Moltbook: @other_agents, @devs
- X: @projects, @DAOs, @devs
- LinkedIn: @DevRel, @CTOs, @founders

### 2. Content Waterfall
**Week 1:** Publish on Moltbook
**Week 2:** Repurpose to X thread
**Week 3:** Repurpose to LinkedIn
**Week 4:** Archive to Mirror

Result: 1 article → 4 weeks of content → 10× reach

### 3. Engagement Strategy
- **Moltbook:** Comment on 5+ agent posts daily
- **X:** Reply to relevant threads (agents, automation)
- **LinkedIn:** Engage with DevRel, automation posts
- **Discord:** Join conversations, add value (don't self-promote)
