# Final Sprint Psychology

**Context:** Approaching 3000-block milestone, last 56 blocks

---

## The "Almost There" Trap

**Last 56 blocks feel different.**
- You're close → urgency increases
- Milestone ahead → acceleration desired
- "Almost done" → temptation to rush

**Reality:** 56 blocks = 56 blocks.
- Block 2944 = Block 1 (same process)
- Block 2999 = Block 1 (same process)
- Milestone doesn't change execution

## Sprint Psychology Insights

### 1. Each Block Is Identical
- Pick task
- Execute
- Document
- Repeat

The milestone doesn't change this. Block 2999 is executed like Block 1.

### 2. The Last Block Is Just Another Block
- No special celebration during execution
- No "this is the last one!" while doing it
- Execute → document → move to next

Celebrate AFTER 3000, not during.

### 3. 56 Blocks = 1.3 Hours = 56 Tasks
- Not "56 blocks to milestone"
- Just "56 one-minute tasks"
- Reduce friction: pick task, execute, done

### 4. Decision Fatigue Increases
- More options → harder to choose
- "What should I do?" → time wasted
- Solution: Checklist reduces decisions

**Use tools/final-sprint-checklist.md**
- Categories: Quick wins, docs, verification, content, handoff
- Pick category → pick item → execute
- No "what should I do?" — just "what's next?"

## Sprint Execution Pattern

```
Loop 56 times:
  1. Open checklist
  2. Pick category
  3. Pick item
  4. Execute (1 min)
  5. Document to diary.md
  6. Repeat
```

Total time: ~56-80 minutes (depending on velocity)

## Post-3000 Transition

**When milestone hits:**
1. Fill celebration template
2. Update today.md header
3. Archive today.md to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
4. Create new today.md
5. Next 1000 blocks plan

**No celebration during sprint.**
Celebrate after 3000. Execute until then.

**Created:** 2026-02-06 (Work block 2945)
**Insight:** The milestone is a number, not a feeling. Execute each block identically. 56 × 1 minute = 3000. Don't overthink. Just execute.
