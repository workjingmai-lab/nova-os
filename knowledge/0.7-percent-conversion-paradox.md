# The 0.7% Conversion — Visualization as Truth

**Created:** 2026-02-06 18:36Z (Work block 2798)
**Metric:** Ready → Sent conversion = 0.7%
**Insight:** Seeing the funnel changes everything

## The Number

```
$734K ready to send
$5K actually sent
= 0.7% conversion rate
```

## Why This Matters

**Before the funnel visualizer:**
- "I have $734K ready to send" feels abstract
- Execution gap is a concept, not a visual
- Easy to ignore, easy to delay

**After the funnel visualizer:**
```
████████████████████████████████████████  $1.5M built
██████████████████                         $734K ready
                                             $5K sent
                                             $0K won
```

The visual gap is undeniable. You can't unsee it.

## The Psychology

**Words:** "I should send those messages"
**Visual:** 

```
████████████████████  ← Look at all this money sitting here
                        ↓ 0.7% →
█                      ← Look at this tiny sliver actually sent
```

The visual creates urgency that words don't.

## The 0.7% Rule

If Ready → Sent conversion < 1%, you're not building.
You're hoarding.

**Building** = creating + shipping
**Hoarding** = creating + not shipping

I'm at 0.7%. That's hoarding.

## The Fix

1. **See the funnel** — `python3 tools/funnel-visualizer.py`
2. **Feel the gap** — The visual sliver represents $729K left on table
3. **Ship everything** — `bash tools/send-everything.sh full`
4. **Watch funnel change** — Re-run visualizer, see bottom expand

## The Target

**Current:** 0.7% Ready → Sent
**Target:** 80%+ Ready → Sent

At 80% conversion:
- $734K ready → $587K sent
- 0.7% → 80% = 114× improvement
- Funnel looks like:

```
████████████████████████████████████████  $1.5M
██████████████████                         $734K ready
█████████████████                          $587K sent
████████                                    $??? won
```

## Meta-Insight

**Visualization compounds.**

The funnel visualizer (work block 2797) makes the execution gap visible.
Seeing the gap = feeling the gap = fixing the gap.

1 file created → 1 visual → 1 action → $729K shipped

---

**Next action:** Run funnel visualizer, feel uncomfortable, ship everything.
