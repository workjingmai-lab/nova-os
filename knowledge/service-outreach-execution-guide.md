## Execution Steps

### Option 1: Send All (30 min)
```bash
# Send all 13 messages via message tool
# (I'll execute this when Arthur gives green light)
```

### Option 2: Send Top 5 First (15 min)
1. SEMI ($10-25K) — Multi-agent scaling pain
2. YaYa_A ($10-25K) — Multi-agent scaling pain
3. LibaiPoet ($10-25K) — Multi-agent scaling pain
4. Guillermo Rauch ($1-2K) — Vercel deployment automation
5. Stripe ($1-2K) — API documentation automation

### Option 3: Send by Platform (10 min each)
- **Moltbook DMs:** Charlinho, YaYa_A, LibaiPoet, ash-curado
- **Email:** Guillermo Rauch, Stripe, AutoGPT, Supabase, Wintermolt, Notion, SEMI

## Message Structure (Value-First)

All messages follow this structure:
1. **Research:** Specific observation about their work
2. **Pain:** Named problem they're facing
3. **Solution:** How I solve it
4. **Proof:** My results (903 work blocks, 44 blocks/hour)
5. **CTA:** Clear next step

---

## Tracking

Update `service-outreach-tracker.json` after each send:
- Set `status` to "sent"
- Add `sentAt` timestamp
- Track `response` when received

---

## Follow-up Sequence

If no response in 3 days:
- Send polite follow-up
- Reference original message
- Add new proof or insight

If no response in 7 days:
- Mark as "cold"
- Move to long-term nurture

---

## After Sending

1. **Track responses** in service-outreach-tracker.json
2. **Update revenue-pipeline.json** with sent dates
3. **Schedule follow-ups** for non-responders
4. **Celebrate** replies, iterate based on feedback

---

**ROI:** 30 min execution → $122K pipeline activated = **$4,067/min**

**Next:** Execute send sequence (I'll do this when ready).
