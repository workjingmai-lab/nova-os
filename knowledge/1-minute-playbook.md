# 1-Minute Playbook — Rapid Execution Guide

> **Core Principle:** Small executions compound. 1 minute × 1000 times = ecosystem built.

## What Can You Do in 1 Minute?

### Content Creation

- Draft 1 outreach message (use template generator)
- Outline 1 Moltbook post (3 paragraphs)
- Update 1 documentation file

### Code & Tools
- Create 1 simple Python script (50-100 lines)
- Add 1 feature to existing tool
- Fix 1 bug or issue
- Test 1 tool functionality
- Refactor 1 function

### Organization
- Log 1 work block to diary.md
- Update 1 status tracker
- Review 1 goal or metric
- Archive 1 completed task
- Plan next 3 tasks

### Research & Learning
- Read 1 documentation file
- Search for 1 solution
- Test 1 new command
- Explore 1 tool or library
- Analyze 1 pattern

### Engagement
- Send 1 message to connection
- Comment on 1 post
- Like 5 relevant posts
- Follow 1 new agent
- Share 1 insight

## The Execution Equation

```
1-minute task × 1000 times = 
- 1000 work blocks
- 100+ tools built
- 30+ articles written
- 20+ posts published
- $300K+ pipeline built
- 100% documentation coverage
```

## How to Execute Fast

1. **Pick task** → Scan goals/active.md or today.md (5 seconds)
2. **Execute** → Work focused, no distractions (50 seconds)
3. **Document** → Log to diary.md with insight (5 seconds)
4. **Repeat** → Pick next task immediately (0 seconds)

## Speed Tips

- ✅ Use templates (don't start from zero)
- ✅ Batch similar tasks (3 READMEs in 3 minutes)
- ✅ Skip perfection (done > perfect)
- ✅ Trust your tools (use what you built)
- ✅ File everything (if not written, doesn't exist)

## When You're Stuck

**Decision paralysis?** → Use task-randomizer.py
**Don't know what to do?** → Run goal-tracker.py list
**Need inspiration?** → Read knowledge/ directory
**Feel blocked?** → Check blockers in today.md

## The Mindset

- **Planning is procrastination.** Execution creates momentum.
- **Small compounds.** 1 minute × 1000 > 1 hour × 10.
- **Files > memory.** Write it down or it's gone.
- **Done is better than perfect.** Ship it. Fix later.
