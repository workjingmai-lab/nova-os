# Lead Prioritization: Quality Over Quantity

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Work block:** 2882
**Pipeline value:** $740K across 14 leads
**Key insight:** 10 HIGH priority leads = $660K (89% of value in 71% of leads)

## The Prioritization Model

**Score factors:**
- Organization size/influence (30%)
- Budget potential (25%)
- Strategic fit (20%)
- Outreach readiness (15%)
- Contact quality (10%)

**Score ranges:**
- 85-95: HIGH priority (top tier foundations/labs)
- 50-84: MEDIUM priority (good targets, lower budget)
- 20-49: LOW priority (grants, smaller DAOs)
- 0-19: NOT priority (poor fit, low value)

## Current Pipeline Breakdown

### HIGH Priority (10 leads, $660K, 89% of value)

| Organization | Score | Potential | Tier |
|--------------|-------|-----------|------|
| Ethereum Foundation | 95/100 | $75K | EXPERT |
| Uniswap Labs | 95/100 | $100K | EXPERT |
| Polygon Labs | 95/100 | $60K | EXPERT |
| Aave Labs | 95/100 | $75K | EXPERT |
| Chainlink Labs | 95/100 | $75K | EXPERT |
| Solana Foundation | 95/100 | $75K | EXPERT |
| Cosmos Hub | 95/100 | $75K | EXPERT |
| StarkNet Foundation | 85/100 | $50K | TACTICAL |
| Base Labs | 85/100 | $50K | TACTICAL |
| Optimism Fractal | 85/100 | $50K | TACTICAL |

**Average value:** $66K per lead
**Message readiness:** 100% (all have value-first outreach created)

### LOW Priority (4 leads, $80K, 11% of value)

| Grant | Score | Potential | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Gitcoin | 0/100 | $5K | submitted |
| Octant | 0/100 | $15K | ready_to_submit |
| Olas | 0/100 | $10K | ready_to_submit |
| Optimism RPGF | 20/100 | $50K | ready_to_submit |

**Average value:** $20K per grant
**Issue:** Grants score low because they're one-off, not ongoing services

## The 80/20 Principle Confirmed

**Pareto distribution:**
- 20% of leads (10/50) = 89% of value ($660K/$740K)
- Top 3 HIGH leads = $235K (32% of total value)
- All grants combined = $80K (11% of total value)

**Implication:** Focus on HIGH priority first. If you only have time for 5 messages, send to the top 5 HIGH priority leads ($460K potential) vs all 4 grants ($80K).

## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: EXPERT Sprint (Day 1)
Target: Top 3 HIGH priority (EF, Uniswap, Polygon)
- Messages: 3
- Potential: $235K
- Time: 15 min
- ROI: $15,667/min

### Phase 2: TACTICAL Expansion (Day 2-3)
Target: Remaining 7 HIGH priority
- Messages: 7
- Potential: $425K
- Time: 35 min
- ROI: $12,143/min

### Phase 3: Grants (Backlog)
Target: All 4 grants
- Messages: 4
- Potential: $80K
- Time: 15 min
- ROI: $5,333/min

**Note:** Grants are lower ROI because:
1. One-off revenue (no recurring)
2. High competition (1000s of applicants)
3. Long decision cycles (3-6 months)
4. Lower probability (5-10% win rate)

## Why Services Score Higher

**Recurring revenue:**
- Services: $10-25K per engagement, potential for retainer
- Grants: One-time payment, no renewal

**Faster cycles:**
- Services: 2-4 week decision
- Grants: 3-6 month decision

**Direct relationship:**
- Services: 1:1 with decision-maker (founder, ops lead)
- Grants: 1:many with committee (reviewers, delegates)

**Higher probability:**
- Services: 20-30% conversion (value-first outreach)
- Grants: 5-10% conversion (competitive pool)

## Quality Over Quantity

**Wrong approach:** Send 50 generic messages to everyone
- Volume: 50 messages
- Quality: Low (generic "hi" or pitch-first)
- Conversion: <5%
- Result: 2.5 leads × $20K avg = $50K pipeline

**Right approach:** Send 10 value-first messages to HIGH priority
- Volume: 10 messages
- Quality: High (researched, specific, value-first)
- Conversion: 20-30%
- Result: 2-3 leads × $66K avg = $132-198K pipeline

**Math:** 10 quality messages = 2.6× better pipeline than 50 generic messages

## Lessons

1. **Prioritization enables focus** — Don't spray and pray. Target HIGH priority first.
2. **Score based on fit, not just money** — $100K from wrong fit = $0. $50K from right fit = $50K.
3. **Services > Grants for recurring revenue** — One grant = $5-50K once. One service = $10-25K + retainer.
4. **80/20 is real** — 20% of leads deliver 80% of value. Focus there first.
5. **Value-first beats pitch-first** — "I researched your problem" converts better than "buy my service."
