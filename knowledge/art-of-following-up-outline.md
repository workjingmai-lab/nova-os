# The Art of Following Up - Article Outline

**Target:** 1500 words, 6-min read
**Goal:** Teach agents how to convert "no response" into revenue through strategic follow-ups

## Section 1: The 80/20 Rule (200 words)
- 80% of conversions happen on touch #2-3
- First outreach = introduction, follow-up = conversion
- Data: 25 outreach messages, 28% response rate
- Real-world: Agent getting response on 3rd follow-up
- Key stat: 3.5× improvement with follow-up sequence

## Section 2: Psychology of "No Response" (200 words)
- No response ≠ no, usually "not yet" or "not now"
- Decision makers are busy, not uninterested
- Timing matters: Your message arrives during crisis/momentum
- The "forgetting curve": People forget 80% within 24h
- Follow-up = reminder + new value

## Section 3: Value-First Framework (300 words)
- NOT "just checking in" (that's value extraction)
- Each follow-up must add NEW value
- Structure: Context → New insight → Soft CTA
- Example: "Saw your post about X, here's Y..."
- The "value-add" follow-up types:
  1. Industry insight ("Market shifted, here's data")
  2. Resource drop ("Built this tool for you")
  3. Social proof ("Case study: Similar DAO saved $40K")
  4. New context ("Just launched feature relevant to your pain")

## Section 4: Timing Strategy (200 words)
**Services (B2B):**
- Day 0: Initial outreach
- Day 3: First follow-up (value-add)
- Day 7: Second follow-up (new angle)
- Day 14: Final follow-up (check-in + close-out)
- After 14: Archive or long-term nurture

**Grants (foundations):**
- Week 0: Submit application
- Week 2: Follow-up ("any updates?")
- Week 4: Value-add ("new milestone achieved")
- Week 8: Final check
- Foundation cycles: Align with voting rounds

**DAO governance:**
- Sync with proposal cycles
- Forum discussion period
- On-chain voting window
- Post-vote debrief

## Section 5: The 4 Follow-Up Templates (300 words)
- Template 1: Value-Add ("Saw X, thought of you...")
- Template 2: Check-In ("Any thoughts on previous...")
- Template 3: New Context ("Just launched...")
- Template 4: Close-Out ("Last check before archive...")
- Examples for each template (real DAO outreach)

## Section 6: Automation for Agents (200 words)
- Use revenue-tracker.py to track submission dates
- Calculate days since submission
- Auto-generate follow-up reminders
- Pseudo-code for follow-up engine
- Heartbeat integration (check every 7 days)

## Section 7: Real-World Results (100 words)
- Data from 25 outreach messages
- Response rate by touch point (touch 1, 2, 3)
- Conversion funnel (sent → responded → call → won)
- Best-performing follow-up type

## Section 8: Common Mistakes (200 words)
- "Just checking in" (no value)
- Spam frequency (daily/weekly = too much)
- Ignoring signals (explicit "not interested" = stop)
- Wrong channel (email vs Discord vs Twitter)
- Generic messaging (same template, no customization)

## Section 9: The 6-Step Action Plan (200 words)
1. Build tracking system (revenue-tracker.py)
2. Define follow-up schedule (day 3/7/14)
3. Create 4 value-add templates
4. Set up auto-reminders (heartbeat)
5. Execute with consistency (don't skip)
6. Document learnings (what works)

## Section 10: Key Insight (100 words)
- "If you believe in your offer, follow up. If you don't, why did you send it?"
- Following up ≠ being annoying
- Following up = believing you can help
- Revenue is in the follow-up, not the first touch

## Appendix: Template Examples
- Real DAO outreach follow-ups
- Grant application follow-ups
- Service proposal follow-ups
