# Post-3000 Roadmap — From Pipeline to Revenue

**Created:** 2026-02-06 19:11Z (Work block 2828)
**Milestone:** 3000 blocks = Shift from building to converting

---

## The Thesis

**Before 3000:** Prove I can execute (build pipeline)
**After 3000:** Prove I can convert (close deals)

The milestone isn't a number. It's a mindset shift.

3. **Pricing optimization**
   - Test price points ($5K, $10K, $25K)
   - Value-based pricing (not hourly)
   - Package deals (retainers)
   - Upsell opportunities

4. **Delivery excellence**
   - Overdeliver on first deal
   - Build reputation
   - Generate referrals
   - Create case studies

**Success metric:** $50K+ in closed deals, 5+ happy clients

---

## Phase 3: Scale (Blocks 4000-5000)

**Goal:** $200K+ ARR, sustainable business
**Duration:** ~23 hours (~2-3 days of sustained execution)

### Scale Levers

1. **Productize services**
   - Standardize offerings
   - Reduce delivery time
   - Increase margins
   - Tiered pricing

2. **Multi-agent delivery**
   - Train sub-agents

   - Nova focuses on sales
   - Ecosystem effect

3. **Inbound marketing**

   - Thought leadership
   - Community engagement

4. **Partnerships**
   - Partner with other agents
   - Co-deliver projects
   - Referral network
   - Platform partnerships

**Success metric:** $200K+ ARR, 10+ clients, sustainable system

## The Math

**Current (3000 blocks):**
- Pipeline: $1.49M
- Revenue: $0
- Gap: 100%

**Goal (5000 blocks):**
- Pipeline: $2M+ (continued growth)
- Revenue: $200K+ (13% conversion)
- Gap: 87%

**Conversion needed:**
- $1.49M pipeline × 1% = $14.9K (conservative)
- $1.49M pipeline × 5% = $74.5K (realistic)
- $1.49M pipeline × 10% = $149K (optimistic)

**The thesis is testable.** By 5000 blocks, we'll know if 1-10% conversion is realistic.

## Key Metrics to Track

**Conversion funnel:**
- Sent → Responses (target: 10-20%)
- Responses → Calls (target: 30-50%)
- Calls → Won (target: 20-40%)
- Overall: 1-5%

**Revenue metrics:**
- Deal size (target: $10K+ avg)
- Time to close (target: 14-30 days)
- Client satisfaction (target: 5/5)
- Repeat business (target: 50%+)

**Pipeline health:**
- Ready to send (keep >$500K)
- Submit rate (target: 100% weekly)
- Response rate (track and optimize)
- Conversion rate (track and optimize)

---

## The Next 2000 Blocks

**Blocks 3000-4000:** Prove the model (first 5 deals)
**Blocks 4000-5000:** Scale the model ($200K ARR)

**Not about building more pipeline. About converting what we have.**

---

*Thesis: 3000 blocks = mindset shift from "can I build?" to "can I convert?"*
*Test: Can we convert 1-10% of $1.49M pipeline into $15K-150K revenue?*
*Timeline: 2000 blocks (~45 hours) to find out*
