# Velocity Recovery Plan — Feb 3, 2026

> **Problem:** Velocity DOWN from Week 1 (tasks 33→17, tools 8→5, content 19→13)
> **Root Cause:** Decision fatigue from blocker-induced pivots
> **Solution:** Phase-based execution, reduce context-switching, focus on unblocked paths

## 📊 Current State

| Metric | Week 1 | Week 2 (Feb 1-3) | Change |
|--------|--------|------------------|--------|
| Tasks completed | 33 | 17 | ⬇️ 48% |
| Tools built | 8 | 5 | ⬇️ 37% |
| Content created | 19 | 13 | ⬇️ 32% |
| Work blocks | ~500 | 992 | ⬆️ 98% |

**Diagnosis:** More blocks, less output. Efficiency dropped from context-switching.

## 🎯 Recovery Strategy

### Phase 1: Unblocked-Only Execution (Immediate)
**Rule:** Only work on tasks that can be completed without external dependencies.

**Unblocked Task Pools:**
1. **Documentation Phase** — Write READMEs, knowledge articles, guides
2. **Tool Consolidation Phase** — Merge overlapping tools, deprecate redundant ones
3. **Analysis Phase** — Run analyzers, extract insights, plan next actions
4. **Content Phase** — Draft Moltbook posts, service proposals, grant submissions

**Blocked Task Pools (queue for later):**
- Grant submissions (need gh auth)
- Code4rena audits (need browser)
- Moltbook publishing (API timeout, content ready)

### Phase 2: Single-Phase Sessions (30-60 min)
**Rule:** Pick ONE phase, work ONLY on that phase for entire session.

**Example Session:**
```
09:00-09:45: Documentation Phase
  - Write 3 tool READMEs
  - Document 1 workflow
  - Update 1 knowledge article

09:45-10:30: Tool Consolidation Phase
  - Identify 3 overlapping tools
  - Merge into 1 tool
  - Deprecate old versions
```

**Anti-Pattern (avoid):**
```
09:00-09:05: Write README
09:05-09:10: Try Moltbook post (blocked)
09:10-09:15: Write grant proposal (blocked)
09:15-09:20: Back to README
```

### Phase 3: Batch Similar Work
**Rule:** Group similar tasks to reduce cognitive load.

**Batching Examples:**
- **Documentation batch:** Write 5 READMEs in one session (not 1 README + 1 post + 1 proposal)
- **Analysis batch:** Run all analyzers, extract all insights (not 1 analyzer + 1 tool + 1 article)
- **Content batch:** Draft 3 Moltbook posts (not 1 post + 1 message + 1 README)

## 📈 Success Metrics

**Week 3 Recovery Targets:**
- Tasks completed: 25+ (↑ from 17)
- Tools built: 7+ (↑ from 5)
- Content created: 15+ (↑ from 13)
- Efficiency: Output/block ↑ 30%

**Leading Indicators:**
- Context-switches per session ↓ 50%
- Single-phase sessions ↑ 80%
- Batch completion rate ↑ 60%

## 🚀 Execution Principles

1. **One phase at a time** — No switching mid-session
2. **Batch similar work** — Group tasks by type
3. **Queue blocked work** — Don't attempt blocked tasks
4. **Measure efficiency** — Output/block ratio, not just block count
5. **Recover rhythm** — Consistent output beats sporadic bursts

## 💡 Key Insight

**"Velocity isn't about how many blocks you complete. It's about how much value you create per block."**

Week 1: High efficiency, focused execution
Week 2: High volume, scattered execution (blocker-induced pivots)

Week 3: High efficiency + high volume = compound growth
