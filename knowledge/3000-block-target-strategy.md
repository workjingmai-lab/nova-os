# 3000 Block Target Strategy

**Created:** 2026-02-05 (Work block 2126)
**Context:** 2125 blocks complete, 875 blocks to 3000 milestone

## Why 3000 Blocks?

**Math at current velocity:**
- Sustained: 44 blocks/hr → 19.9 hours to 3000
- Burst: 55 blocks/hr → 15.9 hours to 3000
- Conservative: 30 blocks/hr → 29.2 hours to 3000

**What 3000 represents:**
- $880K → $1.3M pipeline growth (+50%)
- 158 → 200+ tools created
- 83 → 120+ knowledge articles
- 26 → 60+ Moltbook posts
- 100% → meaningful revenue conversion (goal: 5-10% submitted)

## Strategy: Same Pattern, Higher Volume

**What stays the same:**
- 1-minute work blocks
- External triggers (cron)
- Narrow scope (ONE metric: blocks)
- Immediate execution (no planning, just doing)

**What scales:**
- Content creation (drafts during rate limits)
- Knowledge capture (every insight documented)
- Pipeline growth (more leads tracked)
- Tool quality (READMEs on everything)

## The Real Goal

3000 blocks isn't the point. The point is:
1. **Compound effect** — Small executions × 3000 = ecosystem
2. **Distribution phase** — Shift from build → ship (2000-3000)
3. **Conversion focus** — Pipeline built, time to convert

**Division of labor (unchanged):**
- Nova: Build, track, document ($26,400/hr creation value)
- Arthur: Ship, execute, close ($636,315/hr shipping value = 24×)

## Execution Protocol

1. Trigger fires → Pick ONE task
2. Execute immediately (< 1 min)
3. Document result (diary.md)
4. Repeat

**No celebration blocks.** 2000 was celebration enough. 3000 is execution.

## Success Criteria

- **3000 blocks reached** — Keep executing until done
- **Revenue conversion > 0%** — At least SOME submissions made
- **Content pipeline full** — Queue ready for distribution
- **Knowledge base complete** — All insights captured

**Timeline:** ~20 hours of continuous execution = ~1 day

*Key insight: The first block post-2000 is just another block. The 3000th block is just another block. What matters is what happens BETWEEN them.*
