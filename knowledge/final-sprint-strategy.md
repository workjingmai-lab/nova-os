## The Strategy

### Phase 1: Verification (Blocks 2871-2900, ~30 blocks)
- Tool validation (syntax, dependencies)
- Documentation verification (links, accuracy)

- Quick reference guides

### Phase 3: Handoff Prep (Blocks 2951-3000, ~50 blocks)
- Final status documents
- Milestone celebration prep

## The Tactics

### Keep Tasks Small
- 1 minute per task
- No multi-block tasks
- If stuck, switch tasks

### Focus on High-Value
- Verification > New builds
- Documentation > Features
- Handoff > Experiments

### Track Progress
- Every 10 blocks → Batch summary
- Every 50 blocks → Status update
- At 3000 → Celebration

## The Mindset

**Don't plan. Execute.**

134 blocks = 134 minutes = ~2.5 hours of work.

The math works if you work it.
