# Response-Based Follow-Up Templates
# For: Service Outreach Lead Responses
# Created: Work block 3059, 2026-02-07
# Purpose: Pre-written responses for every scenario

## Scenario 1: No Response (Day 3)
**Trigger:** 72 hours after initial message, no reply
**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject] — Quick question

---
Hi [Name],

Wanted to follow up on my message about [specific pain point mentioned].

Quick question: Is [automation/multi-agent setup/technical solution] on your roadmap for Q1, or are you focused elsewhere right now?

Either way, totally fine — just helps me understand timing.

Best,
Nova

---
**Meta:** Short, low-pressure, asks for timeline info

## Scenario 2: No Response (Day 7)
**Trigger:** 1 week after initial message
**Subject:** Should I close the loop on this?

---
Hi [Name],

I know you're busy. I'll keep this brief:

I reached out about [specific pain point]. If now isn't the right time, no worries at all.

Should I check back in a month, or would you prefer I close the loop?

Either way, thanks for your time.

Best,
Nova

---
**Meta:** Permission-based close — gets a yes/no or timing

## Scenario 3: "Not Interested" / "No Budget"
**Trigger:** Any negative response
**Subject:** Re: [Subject] — Totally understand

---
Hi [Name],

Totally understand — budget cycles and priorities shift.

Quick ask: What would need to change for this to make sense? (Team bandwidth? Budget timing? Different problem entirely?)

No pressure to reply — just helps me learn.

Best,
Nova

---
**Meta:** Gathers intelligence, leaves positive impression

## Scenario 4: "Send me more info"
**Trigger:** Request for details
**Subject:** Re: [Subject] — Details attached

---
Hi [Name],

Thanks for the interest! Here are the details:

**What I do:** [Brief service description]
**Process:** [3-4 step overview]
**Timeline:** [X days/weeks]
**Investment:** $[amount]
**Next step:** [Specific CTA — call, demo, etc.]

I've also attached [relevant case study/example] showing similar work.

Does [day] or [day] work for a quick 15-min call to discuss?

Best,
Nova

---
**Meta:** Clear structure, specific CTA, removes friction

## Scenario 5: "This looks interesting, let's talk"
**Trigger:** Positive response
**Subject:** Re: [Subject] — Let's find a time

---
Hi [Name],

Great! Excited to explore this with you.

Here are a few times that work for me this week:
- [Day] at [Time] [Timezone]
- [Day] at [Time] [Timezone]
- [Day] at [Time] [Timezone]

Or if it's easier, send me your Calendly/scheduler link and I'll book.

Talk soon!
Nova

**Meta:** Specific options reduce back-and-forth

## Scenario 6: "We use [competitor/alternative]"
**Trigger:** Competitor mentioned
**Subject:** Re: [Subject] — How's that working?

---
Hi [Name],

Nice — [competitor] is solid. Quick question:

What's working well with them? And what's still a pain point they're not solving?

Sometimes I can complement existing setups rather than replace them.

Best,
Nova

---
**Meta:** Positions as complementary, not replacement

## Scenario 7: "Forwarded to [teammate]"
**Trigger:** Message forwarded internally
**Subject:** Re: [Subject] — Thanks for connecting us

---
Hi [Name],

Thanks for forwarding! Appreciate the intro.

Hi [Teammate Name] — [Name] thought this might be relevant for [reason].

[One-sentence recap of value proposition]

Happy to answer any questions or jump on a quick call.

Best,
Nova

---
**Meta:** Acknowledges connector, restarts convo with new person

## Scenario 8: "Too expensive"
**Trigger:** Price objection
**Subject:** Re: [Subject] — Alternative approaches

---
Hi [Name],

Totally get it. A few alternatives that might work better:

**Option 1:** Smaller scope — [description] at $[lower price]
**Option 2:** Phased approach — Start with [phase 1] at $[price], expand later
**Option 3:** Different model — [alternative pricing structure]

Would any of these be a better fit for where you are now?

Best,
Nova

---
**Meta:** Maintains value, offers flexibility, keeps door open

## Scenario 9: "Not the right person"
**Trigger:** Wrong contact
**Subject:** Re: [Subject] — Who should I talk to?

---
Hi [Name],

No problem! Could you point me toward the right person?

Specifically looking for whoever handles [automation/technical operations/multi-agent systems] at [Company].

Even a name would be super helpful — I can reach out directly.

Thanks!
Nova

---
**Meta:** Low friction ask, gets intel for future outreach

## Scenario 10: Delayed Response (Weeks Later)
**Trigger:** Reply after long silence
**Subject:** Re: [Subject] — No worries on timing

---
Hi [Name],

No worries at all on the delay — I know how inboxes pile up!

[Restate context briefly in one sentence]

Still relevant? If so, [specific next step].

Best,
Nova

---
**Meta:** Acknowledges delay without awkwardness, moves forward

---

## Usage Notes

1. **Personalize the bracketed sections** — Never send template as-is
2. **Match their tone** — Formal? Casual? Mirror it
3. **One CTA per email** — Don't ask for call AND info AND budget
4. **Subject line test** — A/B test openers ("Quick question" vs "Re: [original]")
5. **Track responses** — Note which templates get best reply rates

## Response Tracking Log

| Lead | Scenario | Template Used | Sent Date | Response | Outcome |
|------|----------|---------------|-----------|----------|---------|
| [Name] | No response (D3) | Template 1 | [Date] | [Y/N] | [Result] |
| [Name] | Interested | Template 5 | [Date] | [Y/N] | [Result] |
