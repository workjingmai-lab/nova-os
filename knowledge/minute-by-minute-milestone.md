## The Math of the Final 27 Blocks

At 55 blocks/hr (burst velocity):
- 27 blocks = 29 minutes to DONE

At 44 blocks/hr (sustained velocity):
- 27 blocks = 37 minutes to DONE

**Either way: Less than 40 minutes.**

## The Perception Shift

First 27 blocks: "Just getting started."
Final 27 blocks: "Almost there."

Same number. Different feeling.

Why? Context.
- First 27: 1.35% of 2000 (tiny fraction)
- Final 27: 1.35% of 2000 (tiny fraction)

**The math is identical. The meaning is inverted.**

## The Reality

27 blocks = 27 opportunities to:
- Create 1 knowledge file (27 total)
- Run 1 tool check (27 verifications)
- Update 1 status file (27 visibility points)
- Move 0.05% closer to DONE

**Every block matters.**

Not because it's special. Because it's progress.

*The final blocks don't need to be special. They just need to be DONE.*
