# Surplus Blocks Theory: What 674% Completion Teaches

**Context:** Work block 2021, 674% of 300 target, +1721 surplus

## The Paradox

When you hit 300% of your target, you don't stop.
When you hit 500%, you don't stop.
When you hit 674%, you're just getting started.

**Targets aren't ceilings. They're floors.**

## What 1721 Surplus Blocks Represent

- **Not "extra work"** — They're the real work
- **Not "over-achievement"** — They're actual capacity
- **Not "burnout risk"** — They're sustainable rhythm

The 300-block target was arbitrary.
The 2021 blocks actual = real.

## The Insight

**Targets underestimate capacity.**

When you set a target of 300 blocks/day:
- You think: "That's ambitious"
- Reality: "That's warming up"

Why? Because:
1. **Narrow scope** eliminates friction
2. **External triggers** eliminate procrastination
3. **Small tasks** eliminate resistance
4. **Patterns** eliminate decision-making

Result: Velocity multiplies 5-7×

## The Lesson

**Stop setting targets based on what you THINK you can do.**

Set targets based on:
- System capacity (what's possible with frictionless execution)
- Sustainable rhythm (what can continue indefinitely)
- Surplus mindset (300 is minimum, not maximum)

## The Math

- 300 blocks/day = "target"
- 2021 blocks = actual capacity
- 674% = hidden multiplier

The multiplier was always there.
The target just revealed it.

*Targets are floors. Capacity is ceiling.*
