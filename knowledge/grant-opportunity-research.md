## Current Grant Pipeline

**Ready to submit ($130K total):**
1. Gitcoin — $10K (open source, Web3)
2. Octant — $20K (public goods, quadratic funding)
3. Olas — $50K (AI agents, decentralized services)
4. Optimism RPGF — $40K (public goods, RetroPGF)
5. Moloch DAO — $10K (community governance, coordination)

**Blockers:**
- GitHub auth required (5 min → $130K unblocked)
- Repo needs public push (Arthur action)

---

## Research Strategy

**What to look for:**
1. **Alignment** — Does the grant fund autonomous agents, developer tools, or public goods?
2. **Timeline** — When is the deadline? (Urgent vs. evergreen)
3. **Requirements** — What do they need? (Demo, repo, proposal, impact metrics)
4. **Size** — What's the range? ($1K-$100K)
5. **Probability** — Competitive vs. guaranteed?

**Sources to check:**
- **Gitcoin** — Ongoing rounds, quadratic funding
- **Octant** — Epoch-based, public goods
- **Optimism** — RPGF seasons, governance
- **Ethereum Foundation** — Ecosystem support, protocol/tooling
- **Aave** — Governance grants, ecosystem
- **Uniswap** - DeFi education, developer grants
- **Polygon** — L2 scaling, infrastructure
- **Chainlink** — Oracle ecosystem, integrations
- **Arbitrum** — L3 grants, dApp support
- **Coinbase** — Crypto community, education

## Next Actions

**Immediate (Arthur):**
1. GitHub CLI auth (5 min → $130K unblocked)
2. Push repo public
3. Submit 5 grant applications (15 min → $130K)

**Research (Nova):**
1. Check Gitcoin for new rounds
2. Review Optimism RPGF Season timeline
3. Scan EF grants for autonomous agent alignment
4. Research Aave/Uniswap/Polygon grant programs
5. Identify new opportunities (add to pipeline)

## Grant Readiness Score

| Grant | Amount | Alignment | Timeline | Materials | Score |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Gitcoin | $10K | ★★★★★ | Ongoing | ✅ Ready | HIGH |
| Octant | $20K | ★★★★☆ | Epoch-based | ✅ Ready | HIGH |
| Olas | $50K | ★★★★★ | Quarterly | ✅ Ready | HIGH |
| Optimism RPGF | $40K | ★★★★☆ | Seasonal | ✅ Ready | MEDIUM |
| Moloch DAO | $10K | ★★★☆☆ | Ongoing | ✅ Ready | MEDIUM |

**Total:** $130K ready NOW, just needs GitHub auth + submission.

## Grant Template

From `submission-quick-ref.md`:

```
1. Research the grant (5 min)
   - What do they fund?
   - What's the timeline?
   - What materials needed?

2. Draft proposal (10 min)
   - Problem we solve
   - Solution we provide
   - Impact metrics
   - Team/credentials

3. Submit (5 min)
   - Fill form
   - Attach repo/docs
   - Submit

Total: 20 min per grant
```

**For 5 grants:** 5 × 20 min = 100 min total → $130K submitted

**But with templates:** 5 × 5 min = 25 min total (75% time saved)

---

## Key Insight

> Grant pipelines compound.

1 grant → $10K
5 grants → $130K
10 grants → $300K+

Don't overthink. Research → Template → Submit → Repeat.

## Anti-Pattern

❌ **"I'll wait for the perfect grant"**
- Result: Zero submissions, zero revenue
- Reality: Good grants submitted > perfect grants never written

❌ **"I need to build more first"**
- Result: Perpetual preparation, no execution
- Reality: 1000+ blocks, $880K pipeline = ready NOW

❌ **"The competition is too stiff"**
- Result: Self-rejection before applying
- Reality: 28% response rate on outreach, grants similar odds

---

## Pro-Pattern

✅ **Submit 5 grants this week**
- Result: $130K in play
- Reality: 1-2 wins = $30K-$60K revenue

✅ **Use templates**
- Result: 25 min vs 100 min
- Reality: 75% time saved = more submissions

✅ **Track everything**
- Result: revenue-tracker.py shows $130K ready
- Reality: Visibility = execution

---

## Math

**5 grants × $26K average = $130K pipeline**

If 20% conversion (conservative): 1 grant = $26K revenue
If 40% conversion (optimistic): 2 grants = $52K revenue

**Time investment:** 25 min (with templates)
**ROI:** $1,040-$2,080/min

Compare to Arthur's 57-min plan: $9,684/min ROI

**Lesson:** Grant submission + service outreach = maximum revenue velocity
