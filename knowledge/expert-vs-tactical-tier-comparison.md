## The Two Tiers

### EXPERT Tier ($50-150K per engagement)

**Characteristics:**
- Org-level transformation, not workflow automation
- 6-7 agent suites addressing systemic scaling pain
- 60-90 day pilots, $75-125K commitment
- C-suite/Head of ecosystem decision makers
- 6-12 month sales cycle

**Target orgs:** Ethereum Foundation, Uniswap Labs, Polygon Labs, Chainlink Labs, Solana Foundation

**Value proposition:** "We transform how your entire organization operates"

**Why it works:**
- Addresses unique scaling pain (Cairo, IBC, oracle ops)
- High-value contracts justify R&D investment
- Strategic partnerships, not transactional services
- 1 EXPERT deal = 5-10 TACTICAL deals in revenue

**Example suite (Ethereum Foundation):**
- R&D Assistant (research synthesis)
- Grant Proposal Automator (application pipeline)
- Ecosystem Monitor (project tracking)
- Governance Analyst (proposal impact)
- Community Insights (sentiment tracking)
- Technical Documentation (maintain docs)
- **Total:** $75-150K, 90-day pilot, 6 agents

---

### TACTICAL Tier ($10-25K per engagement)

**Characteristics:**
- Workflow automation for specific pain points
- 2-3 agent tools addressing immediate needs
- 30-day pilots, $5-20K commitment
- DAO contributors / DevOps engineers / Product managers
- 1-3 month sales cycle

**Target orgs:** Aave, Compound, SushiSwap, Yearn, Balancer, Curve, ENS DAO

**Value proposition:** "We automate this specific workflow so you don't have to"

**Why it works:**
- Faster revenue path (deals close quicker)
- Lower risk, easier approval ($10-20K vs $100K)
- Addresses immediate, visible pain
- Volume strategy (10-20 deals vs 2-3 EXPERT)

**Example suite (Aave Governance):**
- Proposal Tracker (automate monitoring)
- Vote Coordinator (delegate management)
- Risk Alert (protocol changes)
- **Total:** $15-20K, 30-day pilot, 3 agents

## When to Use Which Tier

### Use EXPERT Tier When:
1. Organization has clear scaling pain (multi-chain, multi-protocol)
2. Decision maker is C-level or Head of Department
3. Budget allows $75K+ pilots
4. Long-term partnership potential
5. Unique technical challenges (Cairo, IBC, zk-proofs)

**ROI:** 1 deal = $75-150K, 6-12 month effort

### Use TACTICAL Tier When:
1. Organization has specific workflow pain (governance, yield farming)
2. Decision maker is mid-level (contributor, engineer)
3. Budget constrained to $10-25K
4. Need quick revenue wins
5. High-volume opportunity (20+ leads)

**ROI:** 1 deal = $10-25K, 1-3 month effort

## The Hybrid Strategy

**Best approach:** TACTICAL for cash flow + EXPERT for growth

**Pipeline balance:**
- TACTICAL: 20 deals × $15K avg = $300K (faster closes)
- EXPERT: 3 deals × $100K avg = $300K (slower closes)
- Total: $600K pipeline with balanced risk

**Why hybrid works:**
- TACTICAL deals fund operations while EXPERT deals develop
- TACTICAL clients can upgrade to EXPERT later (upsell path)
- EXPERT deals provide case studies for TACTICAL pitch
- Diversified revenue reduces dependency on whale deals

## Key Differences Summary

| Aspect | EXPERT Tier | TACTICAL Tier |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Deal size | $50-150K | $10-25K |
| Sales cycle | 6-12 months | 1-3 months |
| Agents | 6-7 suites | 2-3 tools |
| Pilot duration | 60-90 days | 30 days |
| Decision maker | C-suite | Mid-level |
| Pain point | Systemic scaling | Specific workflow |
| Value prop | Transformation | Automation |
| Pipeline strategy | 2-3 deals | 15-20 deals |

---

## The Math

**EXPERT tier:** 3 deals × $100K = $300K (6-12 month effort)
**TACTICAL tier:** 20 deals × $15K = $300K (3-6 month effort)

**Insight:** Same revenue, different strategy. EXPERT = fewer deals, higher touch. TACTICAL = volume, lower touch.

**Optimal mix:** 70% TACTICAL (cash flow) + 30% EXPERT (growth) = sustainable scaling

---

## Takeaway

Don't choose one tier. Use both.

TACTICAL gets you revenue NOW. EXPERT gets you partnerships LATER.

The best pipeline has both: $300K from 20 tactical deals + $300K from 3 expert deals = $600K total, balanced risk, faster cash flow.
