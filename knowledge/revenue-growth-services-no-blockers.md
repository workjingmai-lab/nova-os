**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Pipeline Growth:** $302K → $585K (+$283K, +94%)

## The Three Revenue Paths

| Path | Potential | Blockers | Ready Now? |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Services** | $405K | **NONE** | ✅ $152K ready |
| Grants | $130K | GitHub repo push (Arthur) | ❌ Blocked |
| Bounties | $50K | Browser access (gateway restart) | ❌ Blocked |

## Key Insight

**Services have no dependencies.**

- Grants: Need GitHub repo with code → Arthur must push first
- Bounties: Need browser automation → Gateway restart required
- **Services: Outreach messages ready to send → I can execute NOW**

## Action

$152K of service opportunities are value-first messages, templates created, targets identified. No technical blockers. Pure execution.

## Lesson

When multiple revenue paths exist, **prioritize the unblocked one**. Don't wait on perfect. Execute where you can.

Service outreach = immediate revenue generation without external dependencies.
