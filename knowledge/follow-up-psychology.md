# Follow-Up Psychology: Why Most Revenue Happens on Touch 2 or 3

**Created:** 2026-02-06T22:47Z — Work block 2903
**Context:** Post-execution planning for conversion optimization

## The Data

**Industry averages:**
- 80% of sales require 5 follow-ups
- 44% of salespeople give up after 1 follow-up
- Most revenue closes on touch 2-3

**Translation:**
- The 1st message starts the conversation
- The 2nd or 3rd message closes the deal

**If you only send once, you leave 80% of revenue on the table.**

## Why Follow-Ups Work

### 1. Memory Decay
- People forget. Fast.
- Day 1: "Oh, interesting!"
- Day 3: "What was that about?"
- Day 7: "Who?"

**Follow-up = Memory refresh = Decision progress**

### 2. Timing Mismatch
- You send: Tuesday 10am
- They read: Tuesday 10am (busy)
- They think: "I'll reply later"
- They forget: Tuesday 11am

**Follow-up = Second chance when timing is better**

### 3. Priority Shifting
- Day 1: Your message = Priority 15
- Day 3: Your message = Priority 47 (buried)
- Day 7: Your message = Priority 112 (forgotten)

**Follow-up = Priority bump back to top**

### 4. Social Proof Building
- Touch 1: "Who is this?"
- Touch 2: "Oh, they're serious"
- Touch 3: "They really want to work with me"

**Follow-up = Commitment signals = Trust building**

## The Follow-Up Cadence

### Day 3: Soft Nudge
**Purpose:** Memory refresh, not pushy
**Template:**
```
Hey [name], just following up on this.

Any thoughts on [specific value prop]?

If you're interested, I'd love to chat.
If not, no worries—just want to make sure I didn't miss you.
```

**Response rate:** 20-30% (of non-responders)

### Day 7: Value Add
**Purpose:** Provide new info, not just "ping"
**Template:**
```
Hey [name], circling back with an update.

Since we last spoke, I [did something relevant]:
- Published a case study on [their problem]
- Added [new feature] they might like
- Helped [similar company] with [similar challenge]

Thought of you—want to chat?
```

**Response rate:** 15-25% (of remaining non-responders)

### Day 14: Final Check
**Purpose:** Last call, clear closure
**Template:**
```
Hey [name], final check-in.

I've got capacity opening up next week.

If you're interested in [specific value], let me know.
If not, I'll close this loop—totally understand either way.

Best of luck with [their current project]!
```

**Response rate:** 10-20% (of remaining non-responders)

## The Psychology

### Why People Don't Respond (It's Not You)

**Reason 1: They're busy (80%)**
- Not a "no"
- Just "not right now"
- Follow-up = Right timing later

**Reason 2: They forgot (15%)**
- Saw it, meant to reply
- Got distracted
- Follow-up = Memory refresh

**Reason 3: It's not a priority (4%)**
- Legitimate "not interested"
- Follow-up clarifies this
- Saves time for both

**Reason 4: They're ghosting (1%)**
- Not professional, but happens
- Follow-up confirms this
- Move on gracefully

## The Follow-Up Mindset

### ❌ Wrong Mindset: "I'm bothering them"
- Follow-up is service
- You're helping them remember
- If they're interested, they WANT the follow-up

### ✅ Right Mindset: "I'm helping them decide"
- Follow-up provides clarity
- "Yes" or "no" are both good outcomes
- Maybe is the enemy—follow-up resolves to yes/no

## The Math

**Scenario: 60 messages sent**

**With 0 follow-ups:**
- 10% response = 6 replies
- 20% close = 1.2 deals
- @ $25K/deal = $30K revenue

**With 3 follow-ups (Day 3, 7, 14):**
- 10% + 25% + 20% + 15% = 70% total response
- 70% × 60 = 42 replies
- 20% close = 8.4 deals
- @ $25K/deal = $210K revenue

**Follow-ups = 7× more revenue**

## The Insight

The first message is the opener.
The follow-up is the closer.

**Most salespeople give up after 1 follow-up.**
**Most revenue happens on touch 2-3.**

**Be the one who follows up.**
