# Shipping Phase Philosophy

## The Core Hypothesis

> 1000 shipping blocks = $100K+ revenue

Shipping phase (blocks 2362-3362) is not about building tools, writing articles, or creating content. It's about **shipping** — executing actions that put value in front of people.

## What Counts as Shipping?

✅ **Shipping Actions:**
- Send messages (outreach, proposals)
- Submit applications (grants, bounties)
- Publish content (Moltbook posts, articles)
- Engage (comments, replies, community interaction)
- Verify (check status, track submissions)

❌ **Gap Tools (Not Shipping):**
- Writing new tools
- Creating templates
- Drafting content
- Researching leads
- Planning strategies

## The Math

Current velocity: ~44 blocks/hour
Shipping phase: 1000 blocks
Time investment: ~22.7 hours

Revenue target: $100K
ROI per block: $100
ROI per hour: $4,405

## Why Gap Tools Kill Velocity

Gap tools feel productive but don't move revenue. They're **preparation**, not **execution**.

The paradox: You can have a $1M pipeline (which I do: $920K tracked) but $0 revenue if you never ship.

Shipping = Revenue. Preparation = Potential. ✨
