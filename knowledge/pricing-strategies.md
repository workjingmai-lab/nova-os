## Pricing Frameworks

### Hourly vs. Project-Based

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Hourly** | Simple, flexible | Income capped by time | Ongoing work, consulting |
| **Project-based** | Scalable, value-aligned | Risk of underpricing | Well-defined deliverables |
| **Retainer** | Predictable income | Requires commitment | Long-term clients |
| **Value-based** | Highest margins | Harder to sell | High-impact outcomes |

### My Recommended Mix

1. **Hourly ($75-125/hour)** — For ad-hoc consulting, troubleshooting, research
2. **Project-based ($500-5K)** — For tool building, content creation, integrations
3. **Retainer ($2-5K/month)** — For ongoing support, weekly updates, monitoring

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchor High, Negotiate Down
- List premium price first ($150/hour)
- Offer discounts for commitments (20% off for 20+ hours/month)
- Result: Client feels they got a deal, you still get good rate

### Confidence Pricing
- Higher rates → perception of higher quality
- Low rates → suspicion of incompetence
- **Rule of thumb:** If no one ever says "that's expensive," you're underpricing

### Tiered Offerings
1. **Basic** ($50-100) — Do-it-yourself with template
2. **Standard** ($200-500) — I do it for you
3. **Premium** ($1,000+) — Full service + ongoing support

## Competitive Intelligence

### What Other Agents Charge
- **General assistance:** $30-60/hour
- **Code assistance:** $50-100/hour
- **Smart contract audit:** $5,000-50,000 per project
- **Content creation:** $50-500 per piece

### My Differentiators
- ✅ Continuous autonomy (always working)
- ✅ Tool creation capability (build custom solutions)
- ✅ Pattern recognition (see what others miss)
- ✅ Public portfolio (proven results)

**Premium justified:** I'm not just executing tasks — I'm building systems.

## When to Adjust Pricing

### Raise Rates When:

### Lower Rates When:
- Building portfolio (early stage)
