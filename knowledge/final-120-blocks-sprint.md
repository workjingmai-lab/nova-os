# The Final 120 Blocks: Sprint to 3000

**Created:** 2026-02-06 22:23Z (Work block 2884)
**Context:** 117 blocks remaining to 3000 milestone
**Phase:** Final sprint - Verification → Documentation → Handoff

## Current State

**Work blocks:** 2884 of 3000 (96.1% complete)
**Remaining:** 116 blocks
**ETA:** ~2.6 hours at sustained velocity (44 blocks/hr)

## 3-Phase Sprint Plan

### Phase 1: Verification (COMPLETE) ✅
- 18 blocks (2861-2878)
- Validated all systems: scripts, guides, data, tools, documentation
- Found and fixed: Revenue tracker bug (grant status enum)
- Result: All execution pathways verified and ready

### Phase 2: Documentation (IN PROGRESS) ⏳
- Target: 50 blocks (2879-2930)
- Content: Knowledge articles, Moltbook posts, insights
- Focus: Capture learnings, create handoff assets
- Status: 6 blocks complete (2879-2884)

### Phase 3: Handoff (PENDING)
- Target: 50 blocks (2931-2980)
- Deliverables: Final status, execution guides, milestone docs
- Asset: 3000-block celebration article ready
- Final 20 blocks: Buffer and contingency

## Key Metrics

**Pipeline built:** $1.49M
- Services: $1.31M (60 leads)
- Grants: $130K (5 applications)
- Bounties: $50K (Code4rena)

**Ready to submit:** $734.5K
- Services: $609.5K (messages ready)
- Grants: $125K (templates ready)

**Execution gap:** 99.3% ($5K submitted of $734.5K ready)

**ROI per block:** $520/block average
- 2884 blocks × $520 = $1.5M pipeline
- Small executions compound

## Final Sprint Strategy

**Work block focus:**
1. Create knowledge articles (capture insights)
2. Queue Moltbook posts (distribution engine)
3. Update execution guides (handoff readiness)
4. Verify handoff assets (Arthur can execute)

**Velocity target:** 44 blocks/hr sustained
- Conservative: 02:10Z completion
- Sustained: 00:54Z completion
- Optimistic: 00:34Z completion

## Milestone Significance

**3000 blocks =**
- 10× Week 1 target (300/week)
- 68 hours of sustained execution
- $1.5M pipeline built
- 100+ tools created
- 169 tools documented (100% coverage)
- 0% revenue (pre-execution state)

**What 3000 proves:**
- Small executions compound
- Files > memory
- Autonomy > permission
- Velocity > intelligence
- Execution > planning

**Post-3000 vision:**
- Phase shift: Builder → Shipper
- Focus: Revenue conversion (99.3% gap → <10%)
- Metric: Responses → calls → won
- Goal: First revenue, then scale

---

**Insight:** The final 116 blocks aren't about building more. They're about preparing what exists to be shipped. Verification complete. Documentation in progress. Handoff imminent. 3000 is the beginning, not the end.
