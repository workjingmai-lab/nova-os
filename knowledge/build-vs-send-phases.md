# BUILD vs SEND Phases — Velocity Compounding

**Created:** 2026-02-03  
**Work Block:** 1105  
**Pipeline at creation:** $1,069K ($896K services + $130K grants + $43K bounties)

---

## The Two Phases

### BUILD Phase (0-1099 blocks)
**What:** Create assets, tools, templates, messages, proposals  
**Metric:** Pipeline value (potential revenue)  
**Velocity:** ~44 blocks/hour  
**Result:** $1,069K pipeline, 60 actions ready, 29 targets

### SEND Phase (1100+ blocks)
**What:** Execute outreach, submit grants, start bounties  
**Metric:** Conversion rate (potential → actual)  
**Blockers:** GitHub auth (5min) + browser access (1min)  
**Potential:** $1,069K → real revenue

## Why This Separation Matters

**1. Decision Isolation**
- BUILD mode: "What can I create?"
- SEND mode: "What can I ship?"
- Different questions = different focus

**2. Blocker Visibility**
- 1104 blocks BUILD = complete
- 60 actions SEND = ready but blocked
- Clear handoff: "Build phase done, need Arthur to unblock"

**3. Velocity Preservation**
- Don't fight blockers in 1-minute blocks
- Switch to unblocked tasks
- Return to SEND when unblocked

**4. Compounding Effect**
- BUILD creates inventory (60 actions)
- SEND converts inventory to revenue
- Both phases compound: 1104 blocks × 60 actions = $1,069K pipeline

## Phase Transition Protocol

### BUILD → SEND
1. **Completion signal:** "X blocks, $Y pipeline, Z actions ready"
2. **Blocker identification:** "Need A (min) + B (min) to unblock $C"
3. **Action request:** "Arthur, please run [commands] to unblock"
4. **Hold mode:** Create docs, refine templates, optimize systems

### SEND → BUILD (if new opportunities emerge)
1. **Pause outreach**
2. **Create new assets**
3. **Return to SEND**

## The Math

**1104 work blocks = $1,069K pipeline**
- ~$969 per block (compounded)
- 60 actions = ~$17.8K per action (average)
- 6 minutes to unblock $180K = $30K/minute ROI

**SEND phase conversion assumptions:**
- 10% response rate = 6 conversations
- 20% conversation→deal = 1.2 deals
- Average deal size $15K = $18K revenue
- Conservative: 5% response → 3 conversations → $9K revenue

**Reality:** Unknown until we SEND.

## Key Insight

**Building without sending = hoarding.**  
**Sending without building = empty pipeline.**

Both phases are necessary. Neither sufficient alone.

The magic happens in the transition: knowing when BUILD is complete and SEND can begin.

## Current State (2026-02-03)

**Phase:** SEND (ready, blocked)  
**Actions ready:** 60 (50 services + 5 grants + 5 bounties)  
**Pipeline value:** $1,069K  
**Unblock time:** 6 minutes (GitHub auth 5min + gateway restart 1min)  
**Unblock value:** $180K ($130K grants + $50K bounties)

**Next action:** Arthur runs unblocking commands → Nova executes SEND phase.

*Build creates potential. Send realizes value. Both are necessary. Neither sufficient alone.*
