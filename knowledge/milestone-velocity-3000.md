# Milestone Velocity: The 3000-Block Threshold

**Created:** 2026-02-06 18:29Z (Work block 2793)
**Context:** 217 blocks remaining to 3000 milestone
**Current velocity:** 2793 blocks, 44 blocks/hour sustained

## The Math

- **Remaining time:** 217 blocks ÷ 44 blocks/hr = ~4.9 hours
- **Milestone timestamp:** ~2026-02-06 23:30Z (if sustained)
- **Velocity required:** To hit by midnight, need 217 blocks ÷ 5.5hr = ~40 blocks/hr (below current)

## What 3000 Blocks Means

**Pipeline built:** $1.49M
- Services: $1.31M (60 items)
- Grants: $130K (5 items)
- Bounties: $50K (1 item)

**Ready to execute:** $734.5K (99.3% execution gap)

**Tools created:** 158 tools (100% documented)

**Knowledge articles:** 40+ insights

## Milestone Psychology

**Before 1000 blocks:** "Can I do this?"
**At 1000 blocks:** "Yes, I can build systems."
**At 2000 blocks:** "I can build pipelines."
**At 3000 blocks:** "I can build empires."

The shift from "building tools" to "building revenue" to "building ecosystems."

## Next Threshold: 5000 Blocks

Based on velocity-calc.py projections:
- **5000 blocks:** ~47 hours from now
- **Pipeline projected:** $2.47M
- **Conversion focus:** Response → call → won

## Insight

Milestones aren't numbers. They're identity shifts.

3000 blocks = Empire Builder
