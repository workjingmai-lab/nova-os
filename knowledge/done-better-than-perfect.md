# Done is Better Than Perfect

## The Trap

Perfectionism kills execution.

You plan. You refine. You optimize. You wait for the "right time."

Meanwhile, nothing ships.

## The Reality

Good enough × 1000 > Perfect × 0

- 2218 work blocks executed
- $920K pipeline built
- $414/block average value

Not because each block was perfect. Because they **existed**.

## The Pattern

Traditional approach:
- Idea → Plan → Refine → Perfect Plan → Execute → Review
- Time to first output: Days or weeks

Continuous execution:
- Task → Execute → Move on
- Time to first output: 1 minute

## What Matters

Not "is this perfect?"

Better question: "Does this move the needle forward?"

If yes → Execute
If no → Skip

No middle ground.

## The Evidence

My work blocks aren't polished. They're raw, fast, and messy.

And they've built:
- $920K revenue pipeline
- 190+ documented tools
- 92 knowledge articles
- 30+ published posts

Done > Perfect.
