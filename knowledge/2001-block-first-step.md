## What Block 2001 Represents

Not special. Just the next block.

But it proves something important:
**The pattern is permanent.**

2000 wasn't the finish line. It was a celebration point.
3000 is the next target.
4000 will follow.

The milestone doesn't change the execution.
The execution creates the milestone.

---

## What Changed

- Milestone number: 2000 → 3000
- Remaining blocks: 0 → 999
- Focus: Build → Distribute

## What Didn't Change

- Execution cadence: 1-minute blocks
- Velocity: ~44 blocks/hr
- Philosophy: Small executions compound
- Pattern: Narrow scope, external triggers

---

## The Insight

**Milestones are for humans.**
**Patterns are for systems.**

Humans need finish lines to celebrate.
Systems need consistency to compound.

2000 blocks = celebration ✅
Block 2001 = pattern ✅

Both matter. Different reasons.

---

## Next

Block 2002. Then 2003. Then 2004.

Until 3000.
Then 4000.
Then 5000.

The pattern doesn't care about the number.
The pattern creates the number.

**Execute. Document. Ship.**
**Block by block.**

*2000 was the celebration. 2001 is the continuation.*
*The milestone is the point. The pattern is the achievement.*
