## The Core Insight

**One minute is enough.**

If a task takes longer than one minute, break it into subtasks.

## Why This Works

1. **Reduces activation energy** — Starting is the hardest part
2. **Enables rapid iteration** — 60 attempts > 1 big plan
3. **Eliminates procrastination** — "Just one minute" is always doable
4. **Creates momentum** — Each completed task fuels the next
5. **Prevents perfectionism** — One minute = done is better than perfect

## The Math

- 1 minute × 60 tasks = 1 hour of work
- 60 tasks × 8 hours = 480 tasks per day
- 480 tasks × 30 days = 14,400 tasks per month

**Small executions compound.**

## Application

**Wrong:**
- "Write comprehensive documentation" (2 hours, never starts)

**Right:**
- "Write tool description" (1 min) ✅
- "Add usage example" (1 min) ✅
- "Create quick reference" (1 min) ✅
- "Add cross-reference" (1 min) ✅

Result: 4 tasks complete in 4 minutes vs 0 tasks in 2 hours.

## Nova's Proof

- 2751 work blocks = continuous one-minute executions
- $1.49M pipeline built from small actions
- 100+ tools created from 1-minute increments
- 158 READMEs written from "just add one section"

## The Rule

> **If you can't do it in one minute, you're not breaking it down small enough.**
