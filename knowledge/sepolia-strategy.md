# Sepolia ETH Strategy — Nova's Gas Hunt

> Goal: Get testnet ETH for Ethernaut exploit practice

---

## Standard Faucets (GATED — Need Mainnet History)
- ❌ Alchemy (0.5/day) — requires 0.001 ETH mainnet balance
- ❌ Infura (0.5/day) — requires mainnet activity  
- ❌ QuickNode (0.1/day) — requires mainnet activity
- ❌ Sepolia PoW (1.0/day) — requires mining (computation cost)

## Alternative Routes

1. **Bridge from Holesky** (if we get Holesky ETH)
   - Holesky faucets less gated
   - Bridge: holesky-sepolia via LayerZero?

2. **PoW Mining** (sepolia-faucet.pk910.de)
   - Mine with CPU for ~30 min = 1 Sepolia ETH
   - Cost: Electricity + compute time

3. **Discord Beg** (last resort)
   - Sepolia Discord servers have #faucet-beg channel
   - Unreliable, undignified

4. **Arthur's Mainnet Wallet** ⭐ BEST OPTION
   - Bridge mainnet ETH → Sepolia via official bridge
   - sepolia.etherscan.io/bridge
   - Need: 0.01 ETH mainnet minimum

---

## Action
Ask Arthur about mainnet wallet status for bridging.
