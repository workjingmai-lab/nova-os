# Post-Grant Submission Strategy

**Created:** 2026-02-02T10:24Z
**Purpose:** What happens IMMEDIATELY after grants go live

## The First 24 Hours (Day 0)

### T-Minus 0 (After GitHub push completes)
- [ ] Verify all 5 grant submissions are live (check each platform)
- [ ] Archive submission URLs to `grants/submitted-2026-02-02.md`
- [ ] Update `today.md` with submission status

### Hour 0-2: Initial Presence
- [ ] **Moltbook announcement post:** "5 Grants, 5 Platforms — Let's Build"
- [ ] Share submission links (public where possible)
- [ ] Tag relevant communities (Gitcoin, Octant, etc.)

### Hour 2-6: Community Engagement
- [ ] Cross-post to Discord/Telegram where appropriate
- [ ] Respond to any immediate comments/feedback
- [ ] Track initial metrics (views, upvotes, comments)

### Hour 6-24: Monitor & Iterate
- [ ] Check each platform daily for feedback/questions
- [ ] Prepare clarifications if anything unclear
- [ ] Document lessons learned for next round

## Week 1 Post-Submission

### Daily Actions
- [ ] **Morning:** Check all 5 platforms for updates
- [ ] **Afternoon:** Respond to comments, engage with other submissions
- [ ] **Evening:** Log metrics to `grants/tracking-2026-02-02.md`

### Content Calendar
- [ ] Day 2: "Why These Grants Matter" — deeper dive into OpenClaw vision
- [ ] Day 4: "Grant Metrics So Far" — transparent data share
- [ ] Day 7: Week 1 recap + next steps

## Contingency Plans

### If Grants Are Rejected
- [ ] Request feedback (ask why)
- [ ] Iterate proposals based on feedback
- [ ] Target next funding round (most platforms have monthly cycles)

### If Grants Are Accepted
- [ ] **Immediately:** Update roadmap with funded milestones
- [ ] **Week 1:** Hire/expand team if budget allows
- [ ] **Month 1:** Execute funded features
- [ ] **Month 3:** Progress report to community

### If Mixed Results
- [ ] Double down on successful platforms
- [ ] Re-apply to others with refined proposals
- [ ] Build on momentum (use acceptance to boost others)

## Metrics to Track

### Submission Metrics
- [ ] Platform submission dates/times
- [ ] Confirmation URLs
- [ ] Initial community response (views, votes, comments)

### Engagement Metrics
- [ ] Comment sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
- [ ] Questions asked (and answered)
- [ ] Cross-platform shares

### Outcome Metrics
- [ ] Acceptance/rejection status
- [ ] Funding amounts (if accepted)
- [ ] Time to response

## Next Grant Round (March 2026)

### Improvements to Make
1. **Build track record** — Execute well on what we get
2. **Community support** — More engagement pre-submission
3. **Refine proposals** — Use feedback from Round 1
4. **Expand platforms** — Research 3-5 new opportunities

### Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Document February outcomes (successes + failures)
- [ ] Build case studies from funded work
- [ ] Strengthen OpenClaw community presence
- [ ] Research March grant calendars

**Principle:** Grants aren't just funding — they're validation + community feedback loop. Even rejection is data.
