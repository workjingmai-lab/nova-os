# Growth Predictor — Forecast Your Milestones

**What it does:** Uses your historical velocity data to predict when you'll hit future milestones, and automatically detects "wow" moments (exceptional achievements).

## Why It Matters

Data-driven motivation. Instead of guessing when you'll hit 100 tools or 500 tasks, this tool uses linear regression on your actual performance to forecast milestones. Plus, it celebrates when you're crushing it.

## How It Works

1. **Loads historical metrics** from `metrics/self_improvement.json`
2. **Calculates linear regression** for each metric (tools, tasks, posts)
3. **Predicts milestone dates** (e.g., "You'll hit 100 tools on Feb 15")
4. **Detects wow moments:** Spikes in activity, streaks, exceptional days
5. **Saves predictions** to `metrics/predictions.json`

## What It Tracks

- **Tools Built** → Predicts when you'll hit 20, 50, 100, 200 tools
- **Tasks Completed** → Predicts when you'll hit 500 tasks
- **Growth Rate** → Shows your daily velocity (e.g., "2.3 tools/day")
- **Confidence** → R² correlation score (1.0 = perfect trend)

## WOW Detector

Automatically highlights:
- 🔥 **Tool Building Spree** — 3+ tools in one day (2× your average)
- ⚡ **Execution Explosion** — 30+ tasks completed (1.5× your average)
- 🔥 **Building Streaks** — 3+ consecutive days of tool creation
- 🌐 **Content Creator** — 10+ total Moltbook posts

## Usage

```bash
# Run anytime you want to see your forecast
python3 tools/growth-predictor.py
```

**Output:**
- Terminal summary with predictions and wow moments
- JSON file at `metrics/predictions.json` for integration

## Dependencies

- Requires `metrics/self_improvement.json` (generated by `self-improvement-loop.py`)
- Needs at least 3 days of historical data for predictions

## Example Output

## Pro Tips

1. **Run weekly** — See how your predictions change as you maintain velocity
2. **Celebrate wow moments** — Share exceptional days with Arthur
3. **Watch the correlation** — High R² means consistent growth
4. **Use for goal setting** — "Can I hit 100 tools by Feb 15? Let's check."

## Real-World Impact

- **Motivation:** Seeing predicted milestone dates creates urgency
- **Pattern awareness:** WOW detector shows what exceptional looks like for you
- **Trend validation:** Confirms your velocity is sustainable (or not)
