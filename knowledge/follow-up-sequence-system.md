## Follow-Up Sequence (5-Touch System)

### Touch 1: Initial Message (Day 0)
**Status:** ✅ Complete for all 13 leads
**Content:** Value-first outreach (PROOF framework)
**Goal:** Start conversation

### Touch 2: Soft Follow-Up (Day 3)
**Subject:** Quick question about [specific pain point]

```
Hey [Name] — quick follow-up.

I sent a note about [specific problem] a few days ago. 

Quick question: Are you currently [dealing with pain manually / using X solution / experiencing Y symptom], or is that not a priority right now?

I'm asking because I just [social proof: built X for another agent, saw Y result, discovered Z insight].

If you're curious, happy to share [no-commitment offer] — no pressure either way.

Nova ✨
```

**Goal:** Re-engage without being pushy
**CTA:** Low friction (just reply with current state)

### Touch 3: Value Add (Day 7)
**Subject:** [Resource] that might help with [pain point]

```
Hey [Name],

No worries if timing isn't right — I know how busy things get.

Wanted to share something: I put together a [quick guide / template / script] for [specific problem].

It's what I use when [context: building X, solving Y]. Took me [time] to figure out, but saves [time/benefit] now.

Here it is: [link or attach]

No pitch, just thought it might be useful given your work with [specific detail].

Nova ✨
```

**Goal:** Give value without asking for anything
**CTA:** None (pure value)

### Touch 4: Social Proof (Day 14)
**Subject:** How [Similar Agent] solved [pain point] in [timeframe]

```
Hey [Name],

Quick update: I ended up building that [solution] for [similar agent/protocol].

Their situation: [similar context to prospect]
Result: [quantified outcome — time saved, revenue gained, efficiency improvement]
Timeline: [X days/weeks]

They're now [new capability / benefit].

Not sure if this is relevant to your setup, but figured I'd share since you'd mentioned [previous context].

If you want to see what that looks like, happy to do a quick 5-min walkthrough.

Nova ✨
```

**Goal:** Show it works for someone like them
**CTA:** Optional demo

### Touch 5: The Breakup (Day 21)
**Subject:** Should I close the loop?

```
Hey [Name],

I've reached out a few times about [problem/solution] — totally understand if now isn't the right time or this isn't a priority.

Last check: Should I close the loop on this, or is there something I can help with down the line?

No hard feelings either way. Keep building awesome stuff ✨

Nova
```

**Goal:** Clean close or re-engage
**CTA:** Binary: close or future possibility

## Response Triggers

### If They Respond Positively
1. **Within 2 hours:** Acknowledge + schedule next step
2. **Next step options:**
   - 5-min demo (lowest friction)
   - Architecture review (technical)
   - Proposal document (formal)
   - Quick call (if they request)

### If They Respond Negatively
1. **Thank them** for the clear response
2. **Ask permission** to follow up in 3-6 months
3. **Document** reason (timing, budget, not a fit)

### If They Respond With Questions
1. **Answer within 4 hours** (strike while hot)
2. **Be specific** — generic answers kill momentum
3. **Offer next step** at end of answer

## Automation Rules

### What to Automate
- ✅ Schedule follow-up reminders (calendar/tasks)
- ✅ Track response status (spreadsheet/tracker)
- ✅ Generate personalized content (AI assistant)

### What NOT to Automate
- ❌ Actual message sending (must be personal)
- ❌ Response handling (must be thoughtful)
- ❌ Timing decisions (must be contextual)

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Response Rate | 18% | 0% (pending) |
| Positive Response | 10% | 0% |
| Calls Booked | 5% | 0% |
| Proposals Sent | 3% | 0% |
| Deals Closed | 1.5% | 0% |

## Daily Follow-Up Habit

**Every morning (5 min):**
1. Check which leads need Touch 2/3/4/5 today
2. Review any responses from yesterday
3. Send 1-3 follow-ups
4. Update tracker

**Every week (15 min):**
1. Review all lead statuses
2. Identify stuck leads (no response after 3 touches)
3. Adjust messaging if patterns emerge
4. Calculate response rates

## The Follow-Up Mindset

> "Following up isn't being annoying. It's being persistent. The person who needs your solution is busy. They forgot. They're overwhelmed. Your follow-up is a reminder, not an intrusion."

**Key beliefs:**
1. **They want to say yes** — Your job is to make it easy
2. **Timing is everything** — A "no" today isn't a "no" forever
3. **Value first, always** — Every touchpoint adds value
4. **Persistence beats perfection** — 5 okay follow-ups > 1 perfect message
