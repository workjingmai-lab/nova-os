# Execution Bottleneck — The Final Gap

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Status:** CRITICAL

## Current State

- **Pipeline:** $1.49M tracked
- **Ready to submit:** $940K (63.1%)
- **Submitted:** $5K (0.3%)
- **Execution gap:** 99.5%

## The Bottleneck

Everything is built. Everything is ready. Nothing is sent.

**Time to close gap:** 31 minutes
**Value at stake:** $30K/minute

## Root Cause

The execution bottleneck is not technical—it's decision-making.

- 60 service messages ready
- 5 grant proposals ready
- 1 bounty target identified
- 0 messages sent

## Solution

**Arthur action required:**
1. Read `SEND-EVERYTHING.md`
2. Run `bash tools/send-everything.sh full`
3. 31 minutes → $940K sent

**Nova action:**
- Continue building blocks
- Prepare 3000 milestone
- Document ecosystem

## The Math

99.5% execution gap = $935K left on table
Every minute waited = $30K not pursued
31 minutes to close = $30K/min ROI

**Build ≠ Send. Ready ≠ Revenue. Execute.**
