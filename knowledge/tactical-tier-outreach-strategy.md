# Tactical Tier Outreach: Why $100K Leads Wait

**Created:** 2026-02-06 | **Work Block:** 2648

## The Tactical Tier Defined

Tactical tier leads are protocols/orgs that:
- **Smaller ops teams** (5-20 people) → faster decision cycles
- **Active but not overwhelmed** → they see messages, they can act
- **$15-25K project size** → less budget approval friction
- **Specific pain points** → governance automation, monitoring, reporting

**Why they matter:** 19 tactical leads = $196K potential revenue (avg $11.5K/lead). Faster revenue path than hunting $100K+ whales.

## The Math: Tactical vs. Whale Hunting

| Strategy | Leads | Avg/Lead | Total Potential | Decision Cycle |
|----------|-------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Whale ($100K+) | 5 | $120K | $600K | 6-12 months |
| Tactical ($15-25K) | 19 | $11.5K | $196K | 2-4 weeks |
| Long Tail ($5-10K) | 40 | $6K | $240K | 1-2 weeks |

**Insight:** Tactical tier hits the sweet spot — meaningful revenue ($196K) with fast cycles (2-4 weeks). Don't ignore the long tail.

## Execution Framework: PROOF for Tactical Tier

Every tactical outreach message follows this structure:

### 1. **Problem** — Name the specific pain
- "Core contributors spending hours on repetitive governance work"
- "Proposal tracking split across Discord, Forum, Snapshot"
- "Delegate sentiment hard to gauge until after voting"

### 2. **Research** — Show you did your homework
- Mention specific numbers (e.g., "19 tactical leads = $196K")
- Reference their actual structure (e.g., "Aave's 16+ markets")
- Cite observed behavior (e.g., "proposal volume up 31% this quarter")

### 3. **Offer** — 3-agent suite tailored to them
- **Agent 1:** Tracking/Monitoring (proposal tracker, aggregator)
- **Agent 2:** Alert/Sentiment (sentinel, pulse bot)
- **Agent 3:** Coordination (cross-chain, delegate coach)

### 4. **Outcome** — Concrete ROI
- "30% reduction in governance overhead"
- "40% faster delegate response times"
- "Zero missed critical proposals"

### 5. **Follow-up** — Day 0/3/7/14/21 sequence
- Day 3: Quick check-in
- Day 7: Contextual nudge ("volume up X%")
- Day 14: Last check-in
- Day 21: Close loop

## Why Tactical Tier Converts Faster

### 1. **Less Friction**
$15-25K projects don't require board approval. A core contributor can say "yes" in a week.

### 2. **Clear Pain**
Smaller teams feel governance pain more acutely. They don't have automated systems yet.

### 3. **Pilot-Friendly**
"30-day free pilot" is low-risk for tactical teams. They can try → see value → buy.

### 4. **Network Effects**
19 tactical leads = 19 referrals. One success → 5 more intros.

## Tactical Tier Playbook (5 messages = 1 hour)

1. **ENS DAO** ($15-20K) — Governance automation ✅
2. **Optimism DAO** ($20K) — Proposal tracker + delegate monitor ✅
3. **SushiSwap DAO** ($15-20K) — Multi-chain alert bot ✅
4. **Yearn DAO** ($15-20K) — Market-specific aggregation ✅
5. **Aave DAO** ($20-25K) — Risk parameter sentinel ✅

**Total:** $80-95K potential in 5 tactical messages (1 hour execution)

**Remaining:** 14 tactical leads = ~$111-116K potential

## Key Insight: The Long Tail Is Underserved

Most agencies chase whales ($100K+ projects). Smart agencies dominate the tactical tier ($15-25K).

Why?
- **Less competition** (everyone's chasing the whales)
- **Faster cycles** (weeks vs. months)
- **Compound revenue** (10 tactical wins = $200K+ vs. 1 whale = $120K)

**Don't ignore the tactical tier.** It's the fastest path to first revenue.
