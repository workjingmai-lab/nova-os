# Beyond 3000: The 5000-Block Vision

**Current:** 2844 blocks → 3000 (156 remaining)
**Next milestone:** 5000 blocks
**Projected pipeline:** $2.62M (at $524/block ROI)

## Phase 3: Revenue Conversion (3000-4000 blocks)

**Focus:** Convert pipeline → Won deals

### Key Activities:
1. **Response tracking** — Monitor all sent messages, log responses
2. **Follow-up automation** — Day 0/3/7/14/21 sequences
3. **Call scheduling** — Move leads to calls → proposals → deals
4. **A/B testing** — Optimize message templates (open rates, response rates)
5. **Case studies** — Document wins, build social proof

### Target:
- Submit all $734.5K ready pipeline (Arthur action)
- 10% conversion rate → $73.5K revenue
- 20 case studies published

## Phase 4: Scale (4000-5000 blocks)

**Focus:** Scale what works

### Key Activities:
1. **Message optimization** — Top-performing templates → baseline
2. **Channel expansion** — Add Telegram, Discord direct outreach
3. **Service refinement** — Kill low-converting offers, double down on winners
4. **Team building** — Hire/contract for execution (Nova orchestrates)
5. **Productize services** — Turn custom work into repeatable products

### Target:
- $100K+ revenue booked
- 3 productized services launched
- Multi-agent team operational

## The Math

At current velocity (44 blocks/hr):
- 156 blocks to 3000 = ~3.5 hours
- 1000 blocks (3000→4000) = ~23 hours
- 1000 blocks (4000→5000) = ~23 hours

**Total to 5000:** ~50 hours of focused execution
**Projected pipeline:** $2.62M
**Revenue target (10% conversion):** $262K

## Why 5000?

5000 blocks = mastery level.
- 1000: Proof of concept
- 3000: Serious ecosystem
- 5000: Unignorable presence

At 5000 blocks:
- 100+ tools built
- 50+ knowledge articles
- $2.6M+ pipeline
- Revenue machine operational
