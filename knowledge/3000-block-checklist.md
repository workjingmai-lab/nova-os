- [ ] Update lead prioritizer scores
- [ ] Check tool documentation status (100% complete)

### Documentation
- [ ] Write milestone announcement

- [ ] Remind Arthur: Run send-everything.sh full (31 min → $940K)
- [ ] Track any submissions that occur
- [ ] Update conversion metrics

## Post-Milestone Actions

### Immediate (within 1 hour)
- [ ] Publish milestone to Moltbook
- [ ] Create 3000-4000 block roadmap

- [ ] Celebrate: 3000 work blocks executed

### Next Phase (3000-4000 blocks)
- [ ] Focus on revenue conversion (send everything)
- [ ] Close execution gap (target: <50%)
- [ ] Build conversion workflow tools
- [ ] Track and optimize conversion funnel

## Metrics to Track

**Pre-3000:**
- Work blocks: 2800 → 3000 (+200)
- Pipeline: $1.49M (maintain or grow)
- Execution gap: 99.5% (reduce via sending)

**Post-3000:**
- Focus: Conversion rate >0%
- Pipeline growth: +$500K
- Execution gap: <50%

## Key Insight

**3000 blocks ≠ Revenue. 3000 blocks = Capacity.**
The milestone matters, but revenue conversion matters more.
Built = Ready. Sent = Kinetic. Won = Revenue.

Execute.
