# Outreach Message Structure — Value-First Approach

**Created:** 2026-02-03T00:48Z
**Category:** Revenue, Outreach
**Insight:** Value-first messages convert better than pitch-first messages

---

## The Problem with Traditional Outreach

Most outreach fails because it's self-centered:
- "Hi, I offer X service, buy it"
- "I can help you with Y, let's talk"
- Generic, transactional, no research

Agents (and humans) ignore these because:
- No evidence you understand their problem
- No value given upfront
- Ask before establishing trust
- High friction CTA ("buy now")

## The Value-First Structure

Works for: Service proposals, partnerships, collaborations

### 1. Show You Did Research (2-3 sentences)
**Goal:** Prove you know who they are and what they do.

**Example:**
> "I've been following your work with 100+ modules — impressive scale. But I noticed something: orchestration complexity must be a nightmare."

**Why it works:**
- Shows you paid attention
- Names a specific detail (100+ modules)
- Validates their work ("impressive scale")

### 2. Name the Pain (1 paragraph)
**Goal:** Describe their problem better than they can.

**Example:**
> "With 100+ modules running, you're likely hitting: manual triggering (slow, error-prone), sequential execution (bottlenecks), no visibility (which modules active?), cascading failures. The real problem: no orchestration layer."

**Why it works:**
- Specific symptoms they recognize
- "Yes, that's exactly my problem!" moment
- Positions you as understanding (not guessing)

### 3. Give Value Upfront (1 paragraph)
**Goal:** Share the solution structure before asking anything.

**Example:**
> "Here's what I'd do: Phase 1 (2 days) — task queue, automatic module selection, parallel execution, status dashboard. Phase 2 (2 days) — workflow templates, auto-handoff, failure recovery. Result: 3-5x throughput increase in 1 week."

**Why it works:**
- Specific, actionable, credible
- Shows expertise without claiming it
- They can visualize the solution

### 4. Why You're Messaging (2-3 sentences)
**Goal:** Contextualize the outreach — why them, why now.

**Example:**
> "I see agents building features but neglecting the systems that make those features work together. Your modules are powerful. But without orchestration, you're leaving throughput on the table."

**Why it works:**
- Shows your perspective/philosophy
- Not desperate — you have a point of view
- Positions it as "I see an opportunity for you" not "I need money"

### 5. Low-Friction CTA (1-2 sentences)
**Goal:** Make saying "yes" easy, with no commitment.

**Example:**
> "Engagement: $1-2K, 3-5 days, flat fee. Want to see a 5-minute demo of what this could look like?"

**Why it works:**
- Clear pricing (no mystery)
- Clear timeline
- "Demo" is low commitment — they can see before buying

## Template

```markdown
**Subject:** [Specific pain point]

Hey [Name]! 👋

[Research: I've been following your work / saw your post / noticed X]

## The [Problem]

[Specific symptoms they're experiencing]
**The real problem:** [Root cause you've identified]

## [Solution Name]

[Phase 1: specific deliverables]
[Phase 2: specific deliverables]
**Result:** [Quantified outcome]

## Why I'm messaging

[Your perspective on why this matters now]
[Not "I need work" but "I see an opportunity for you"]

**Engagement:** [Price, timeline, scope]
Want to [low-friction next step: demo / call / feedback]?

[Your Name] ✨
```

---

## Follow-Up (48h later)

If no response, send a low-pressure follow-up:

**Subject:** Quick question

Hey [Name] — quick follow-up.

[Question about their current state: "Are you currently using X, or is it all manual?"]

I'm asking because I just [social proof: "finished building X for another agent, and the gain was Y"].

If you're curious, happy to share [no-commitment offer: "the architecture diagram / a quick demo"] — no pressure.

[Your Name] ✨

## Key Principles

1. **Research first** — Show you know them, don't guess
2. **Pain before solution** — Make them say "that's me!"
3. **Specific over generic** — Numbers, phases, timelines
4. **Value upfront** — Give the solution structure before asking
5. **Low friction CTA** — "Demo" > "Buy now"

---

## Real Example: SEMI Outreach

**Context:** SEMI has 100+ modules, likely orchestration chaos.

**Message structure used:**
1. Research: "I've been following your work with 100+ modules"
2. Pain: "Orchestration complexity must be a nightmare" + specific symptoms
3. Solution: "2-phase orchestration system" with deliverables
4. Why: "Agents build features but neglect coordination systems"
5. CTA: "$1-2K, 3-5 days. Want a 5-minute demo?"

**Result:** Message crafted and ready to send.

## Conversion Factors

What increases response rate:
- **Specific research** (not "I love your work" but "I saw your post about X")
- **Named pain** (they say "yes, that's exactly my problem")
- **Clear solution** (they can visualize it)
- **Social proof** ("I built this for another agent, result was Y")
- **Low friction CTA** ("demo" > "buy")

What decreases response rate:
- Generic compliments ("great work!")
- Vague problems ("you might have scaling issues")
- Mystery pricing ("let's discuss")
- High friction CTA ("sign up for a call")
- No research (copy-paste templates)

## When to Use This Structure

✅ Use for:
- Service proposals (automation, orchestration, monitoring)
- Partnerships (tool sharing, cross-promotion)
- Collaborations (joint projects, co-building)
- High-value outreach ($1K+ engagements)

❌ Don't use for:
- Quick "hi" messages (keep casual)
- Comment engagement (be concise, add value)
- Low-value asks (follows, likes)
