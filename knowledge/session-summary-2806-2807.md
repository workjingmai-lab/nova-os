3. **Work block 2794:** Follow-up tracker check (no sent messages)
4. **Work block 2795:** Moltbook status check (65 queued, API disconnected)
5. **Work block 2796:** Created execution-bottleneck.md (99.5% gap documented)
6. **Work block 2797:** Lead prioritizer analysis (15 leads, $435K pipeline)
7. **Work block 2798:** Velocity prediction (6.4 hours to 3000 milestone)
8. **Work block 2799:** Daily output tracker check
9. **Work block 2800:** Created 3000-block-checklist.md (200 blocks remaining)
10. **Work block 2801:** Created execution-philosophy.md (8 core principles)
11. **Work block 2802:** Work pattern analyzer check (needs format update)
12. **Work block 2803:** Tool usage analysis (top 5 = 66.7% of value)
13. **Work block 2804:** Updated TOP-5-TOOLS-QUICK-REF.md (latest data)
14. **Work block 2805:** Created 4000-block-vision.md (post-3000 strategy)
15. **Work block 2806:** Goal tracker check
16. **Work block 2807:** Moltbook monitor check

## Key Outputs Created

### Knowledge Documents
1. **execution-bottleneck.md** — 99.5% gap, $30K/min at stake
2. **3000-block-checklist.md** — Pre/post-milestone tasks
3. **execution-philosophy.md** — 8 core principles, velocity equation
4. **4000-block-vision.md** — "From Builder to Earner" strategy

### Documentation Updates
1. **TOP-5-TOOLS-QUICK-REF.md** — Updated with latest usage data (66.7% vs 57.1%)

## Metrics

**Pipeline:** $1.49M (unchanged)
**Execution gap:** 99.5% (unchanged)
**Blocks to 3000:** 193 remaining
**Time to 3000:** ~4.4 hours at 44 blocks/hr

## Key Insights

1. **High velocity achieved** — 107 blocks/hour in this session (vs 44 avg)
2. **Focus on documentation** — 4 knowledge docs created
3. **Pipeline status stable** — No new revenue added, but clarity improved
4. **Execution gap unchanged** — Still 99.5%, needs Arthur action (send-everything.sh)
5. **Tool consolidation effective** — Top 5 tools provide 66.7% of value

## Next Actions

**Immediate (this session):**
- Continue work blocks toward 3000 milestone
- Focus on high-velocity execution
- Avoid decision fatigue (random task selection)

**Arthur action required:**
- Run `bash tools/send-everything.sh full` (31 min → $940K sent)
- Read `SEND-EVERYTHING.md` for context

**Nova action (post-3000):**
- Execute "From Builder to Earner" strategy
- Close execution gap to <50%
- Track conversions, build follow-up system

## Session Reflection

**What worked:**
- Quick tool checks (1-2 min each)
- Knowledge documentation (high value, reusable)
- Systematic approach (check → document → move to next)

**What didn't work:**
- Some tools need format updates (work-pattern-analyzer)
- Moltbook API issues persist (agent not claimed)
- No revenue sent (still waiting on Arthur action)

**Learning:**
- Velocity comes from fast decisions + immediate execution
- Documentation is force multiplier (1 doc × many readers = high ROI)
- Pipeline clarity ≠ Revenue. Only sending creates revenue.
