# Lead Scoring: How to Prioritize Your Pipeline

*Created: 2026-02-06 23:17Z — Work block 2910*

## What Is Lead Scoring?

**Lead scoring = assigning a number (0-100) to each lead based on how likely they are to convert.**

**Why it matters:**
- Focus time on high-value leads
- Stop wasting time on low-probability leads
- Track pipeline quality over time
- Predict revenue more accurately

## The Scoring Framework

### Score Components (0-100 points total)

| Component | Points | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Fit** | 0-40 | How well they match your ideal customer profile |
| **Intent** | 0-30 | How interested they are (signals, behavior) |
| **Value** | 0-20 | How much revenue this deal could generate |
| **Timing** | 0-10 | How urgent their need is |

**Total score = Fit + Intent + Value + Timing (max 100)**

---

## Component 1: Fit (0-40 points)

**Question:** How well do they match your ideal customer profile?

### Scoring Criteria

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 40 pts | Perfect fit — exactly your ICP, ideal industry, right size |
| 35 pts | Great fit — matches 80-90% of ICP criteria |
| 30 pts | Good fit — matches 60-80% of ICP criteria |
| 20 pts | Decent fit — matches 40-60% of ICP criteria |
| 10 pts | Weak fit — matches 20-40% of ICP criteria |
| 0 pts | Poor fit — doesn't match ICP |

### What to Look For

**Industry fit:**
- Web3/DeFi/DAO (high fit)
- Traditional finance (medium fit)
- Unrelated industry (low fit)

**Company size:**
- 10-100 employees (high fit for your services)
- 100-1000 employees (medium fit)
- <10 or >1000 (low fit)

**Budget capacity:**
- Can afford $10K+ services (high fit)
- Can afford $5K-10K (medium fit)
- Can afford <$5K (low fit)

**Use case match:**
- Has clear problem you solve (high fit)
- Might have problem you solve (medium fit)
- Unclear if problem exists (low fit)

## Component 2: Intent (0-30 points)

**Question:** How interested are they based on their behavior?

### Scoring Criteria

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 30 pts | Hot — replied positively, booked call, asked for proposal |
| 25 pts | Warm — replied positively, interested but haven't booked call |
| 20 pts | Mild — replied with questions, engaged but cautious |
| 15 pts | Cold — replied with "not interested" or "timing is bad" |
| 10 pts | Cooler — opened email but didn't reply |
| 0 pts | No response — never replied to outreach |

### Intent Signals

**High intent (25-30 pts):**
- Replied within 24 hours
- Asked specific questions
- Requested call or proposal
- Shared budget/timeline
- Introduced to decision-maker

**Medium intent (15-20 pts):**
- Replied after 2-3 days
- Asked general questions
- Expressed interest but vague

**Low intent (0-10 pts):**
- No response
- "Not interested" reply
- "Too busy" reply
- Ghosting after initial interest

---

## Component 3: Value (0-20 points)

**Question:** How much revenue could this deal generate?

### Scoring Criteria

| Score | Deal Size |
|-------|-----------|
| 20 pts | $50K+ (massive deal) |
| 18 pts | $25K-50K (large deal) |
| 15 pts | $15K-25K (good deal) |
| 12 pts | $10K-15K (decent deal) |
| 8 pts | $5K-10K (small deal) |
| 5 pts | <$5K (tiny deal) |

### Why Value Matters Less Than Fit

A $50K deal that's a poor fit (low score) is less valuable than a $15K deal that's a perfect fit (high score).

**Why?**
- Poor fit deals are harder to close
- Poor fit clients are harder to work with
- Poor fit deals often don't close at all

**Rule of thumb:** Prioritize score over deal size. A 90/100 lead at $15K is better than a 60/100 lead at $50K.

---

## Component 4: Timing (0-10 points)

**Question:** How urgent is their need?

### Scoring Criteria

| Score | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| 10 pts | Urgent — need solution now or this week |
| 8 pts | Soon — need solution within 1 month |
| 5 pts | Sometime — need solution within 3 months |
| 3 pts | Later — need solution within 6 months |
| 0 pts | Unclear — no clear timeline given |

### Why Timing Is the Lowest Weight

Timing changes. A lead with "no urgency" today can become "urgent" next month.

**Focus on fit and intent first.** Timing can be accelerated with urgency tactics.

## How to Calculate Scores

### Example 1: Perfect Fit, Hot Lead

**Lead:** Ethereum Foundation, $75K project, replied immediately, wants call this week

| Component | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Fit | 40/40 | Perfect ICP match, right size, budget capacity |
| Intent | 30/30 | Replied fast, asked for call |
| Value | 18/20 | $75K deal (large) |
| Timing | 10/10 | Urgent (wants call this week) |
| **Total** | **98/100** | **HIGH PRIORITY** |

---

### Example 2: Good Fit, Warm Lead

**Lead:** Mid-sized DeFi protocol, $20K project, replied with questions, timeline unclear

| Component | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Fit | 30/40 | Good fit (60-80% ICP match) |
| Intent | 20/30 | Replied with questions, cautious |
| Value | 12/20 | $20K deal (good) |
| Timing | 5/10 | Sometime (within 3 months) |
| **Total** | **67/100** | **MEDIUM PRIORITY** |

---

### Example 3: Weak Fit, Cold Lead

**Lead:** Random Web3 project, $5K project, replied "not interested"

| Component | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Fit | 10/40 | Weak fit (20-40% ICP match) |
| Intent | 15/30 | Replied "not interested" |
| Value | 8/20 | $5K deal (small) |
| Timing | 0/10 | No timeline |
| **Total** | **33/100** | **LOW PRIORITY** |

## How to Update Scores Over Time

**Initial score (after first message):** Based on research (fit, value, timing) + initial response (intent)

**Score updates:**
- +10 points: They book a call
- +10 points: They request a proposal
- +10 points: They introduce you to decision-maker
- +10 points: Timeline becomes urgent

-10 points: They ghost after initial interest
-10 points: They say "not interested"
-10 points: Timeline pushed out
-20 points: They stop responding

## Using Lead Scoring in Practice

### Step 1: Score All Leads Initially

```bash
# Use lead-prioritizer.py to auto-score
python3 tools/lead-prioritizer.py score

# Manual scoring template
python3 tools/lead-prioritizer.py template
```

### Step 2: Sort by Score

```bash
# See top 10 leads by score
python3 tools/lead-prioritizer.py top --limit 10

# See HIGH priority leads only
python3 tools/lead-prioritizer.py filter --min-score 90
```

### Step 3: Focus on Top Scores

**Time allocation:**
- 80% on 90-100 scores (HIGH priority)
- 15% on 70-89 scores (MEDIUM priority)
- 5% on 50-69 scores (LOW priority)
- 0% on 0-49 scores (archive)

### Step 4: Update Scores Daily

**When actions happen:**
- Call booked → Update score
- Proposal sent → Update score
- Reply received → Update score
- Ghosting → Update score

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Mistake 1:** Scoring based on gut feeling
✅ **Right:** Use objective criteria (fit, intent, value, timing)

❌ **Mistake 2:** Overweighting deal size
✅ **Right:** Fit + Intent matter more than Value

❌ **Mistake 3:** Never updating scores
✅ **Right:** Update scores when new info comes in

❌ **Mistake 4:** Focusing on low-score leads
✅ **Right:** 80% of time on 90-100 scores

❌ **Mistake 5:** Ignoring timing changes
✅ **Right:** Update timing score when urgency changes

**Remember:** Lead scoring isn't about predicting perfectly. It's about focusing your limited time on the highest-probability opportunities.
